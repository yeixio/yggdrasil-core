# Development

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.26.3 or newer (`go.mod`)
- Node.js 22
- pnpm 9 (the root `package.json` pins `pnpm@9.15.0`)
- Git

Linux package builds also need `nfpm` 2.41.3, as used by the release workflow. Day-to-day daemon work does not.

## Develop in a container

A dev container ships the full toolchain (Go 1.26.3, Node 22, pnpm 9.15.0) so you
can start without installing any of them locally.

**VS Code** – install the
[Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers),
then run **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container** from the command palette.

**GitHub Codespaces** – open the repository on GitHub and click
**Code → Create codespace on main** (or your branch).

In both cases the container:

- Pre-installs Go module and pnpm dependencies on first create.
- Forwards port 7331 so the daemon is reachable from your browser at
  `http://localhost:7331`.

Once the container is ready, `make start` works as-is — the
`YGGDRASIL_WEB_UI_DIR` environment variable is already set by the container
configuration.

For CPU-only inference, pull a small GGUF model (e.g. `Qwen3-0.6B-Q4_K_M.gguf`)
and add it through the UI or point the daemon at it with `--model`.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yeixio/yggdrasil-core.git
cd yggdrasil-core
make start
```

`make` with no target prints `make help`. `make start` installs web dependencies, writes `web/dist`, builds `bin/yggdrasil-daemon` and `bin/yggctl`, and runs the daemon with `YGGDRASIL_WEB_UI_DIR` set to `web/dist`. Open `http://127.0.0.1:7331`.

`make daemon` stamps the current git commit into both binaries. A build from this tree reports `0.1.0-dev` unless `-ldflags` sets `internal/version.Version`. `yggctl version` and `yggdrasil-daemon -version` print the license and the corresponding-source URL. `yggctl completion <bash|zsh|fish>` prints the completion scripts in `cmd/devctl/completions/`, which the packages also install. Update those scripts when you add a `yggctl` command. Release packaging sets the version as well, so a tagged build points at `tree/v<version>`.

A fork that serves a modified daemon over the network sets its own source URL at build time:

```text
-X github.com/yeixio/yggdrasil-core/internal/version.SourceURL=<url-of-your-corresponding-source>
```

## Run

```bash
make start
```

That is the same as `make run-daemon`. It rebuilds `web/dist` and the binaries, then serves the UI from `web/dist`.

Optional data directory, after `make daemon`:

```bash
YGGDRASIL_WEB_UI_DIR="$PWD/web/dist" ./bin/yggdrasil-daemon -data-dir "$PWD/.ygg-dev-data"
```

`make ui` only builds the web UI. `make frontend` does that and runs the web tests. The Vite dev server is separate and proxies `/api` and `/v1` to the daemon:

```bash
make run-web
```

That listens on `http://127.0.0.1:5173`. The daemon API stays on port 7331.

## Test

```bash
make test
make vet
```

`make test` is `go test ./...`. `make ci` runs format, vet, tests, and the frontend job locally. A push to `main` publishes the README coverage badge from `go test ./... -coverprofile`. CI does not enforce a coverage percentage.

Web tests alone:

```bash
cd web && pnpm test
```

Accessibility check (axe-core in Chromium, over every page with demo data, in both themes at desktop and phone widths; build `web/dist` first):

```bash
cd scripts/screenshots && pnpm install && pnpm exec playwright install chromium && cd ../..
node scripts/screenshots/a11y.mjs
A11Y_PAGES=/chat,/settings node scripts/screenshots/a11y.mjs
```

Any WCAG 2.2 A or AA violation, best-practice violation, or page error fails it, with the element and the reason.

Cluster check (Docker, stub inference, not a GPU test):

```bash
make test-cluster
```

Documentation snapshots:

```bash
python3 scripts/test_publish_docs.py
python3 scripts/publish-docs.py --destination /tmp/ygg-docs-check \
  --version 0.0.0-test --commit "$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
```

## Format and lint

Go formatting is `gofmt` via `make fmt`. CI fails if a Go file outside `web/`, `vendor/`, and `node_modules/` is not `gofmt`-clean.

`make lint` runs golangci-lint v2.14.0 (`.golangci.yml`: errcheck, govet, ineffassign, staticcheck, unused) and `pnpm lint` in `web/`. CI uses the same golangci-lint version. Install it with the upstream install script, or `go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.14.0`. `go vet ./...` still runs on its own.

The web check in CI is `pnpm lint`, `pnpm exec tsc -b --pretty false`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm build`. ESLint covers `web/src` and `web/vite.config.ts`. Generated files in `web/wailsjs` are ignored. Hook rules are `rules-of-hooks` and `exhaustive-deps`. Warnings do not fail the job.

## CI

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on pull requests and on pushes to `main`, on Ubuntu, in two jobs:

- **go:** user-guide publish checks; changelog fragment checks; `gofmt`, `go vet`, golangci-lint, `go test ./...`; then cross-compiles of `yggdrasil-daemon` and `yggctl` for linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64, and windows/amd64 (`CGO_ENABLED=0`). These share one runner, so the module and build caches are reused.
- **frontend:** web lint, typecheck, test, and build.
- **accessibility:** builds the web UI and runs `scripts/screenshots/a11y.mjs` (axe-core in Chromium) over every page, in both themes at 1440 and 390 px wide. New UI has to meet WCAG 2.2 AA: 4.5:1 text contrast, labeled controls, and headings in order.

To keep runs short:

- **Prose-only changes skip CI:** a change that touches only Markdown, `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, screenshots, brand assets, or issue templates doesn't run it. The user guide JSON is still checked.
- **Superseded runs are cancelled:** a new push to a pull request cancels its older run. Runs on `main` always finish.

On `main`, a third job publishes the coverage badge.

[`.github/workflows/security.yml`](../.github/workflows/security.yml) runs `govulncheck ./...` and `pnpm audit --prod` in `web/`. The audit step does not fail the job (`|| true`). It runs every Monday, and on pushes and pull requests that change `go.mod`, `go.sum`, `web/package.json`, or `web/pnpm-lock.yaml`.

[`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml) runs on tags matching `v*`. It builds packages, writes `SHA256SUMS.txt`, publishes a GitHub Release, and freezes `docs/<version>.json` from `docs/user-guide/guide.json`. Stable tags also update the Homebrew formula and the apt repository. It then tells `yggdrasil-desktop` about the release (see [the release checklist](release-checklist.md)). It does not sign binaries.

[`.github/workflows/screenshots.yml`](../.github/workflows/screenshots.yml) recaptures `docs/screenshots` from demo data, then holds those stills into `demo.mp4` and `demo.gif`. The same run writes iPhone, iPad, and Google Play phone and tablet canvases under `screenshots/appstore/`. The Release workflow runs it after each release is published and attaches the README stills and `demo.mp4` to the release as `screenshot-<name>`. yggdrasil.yeix.io shows the ones attached to the latest release. Start it by hand with a tag to attach them to an existing release, or without one to only capture; either way the files are also kept as a workflow artifact.

Dependabot is configured for Go modules, the web and screenshot npm trees, and GitHub Actions.

## Labels

Issue labels are defined in [`.github/labels.yml`](../.github/labels.yml). GitHub does not create them from that file. Maintainers synchronize them with `./scripts/sync-github-labels.sh`. CI does not run that script.

## Release flow

Tag `v*` → release workflow → Linux `.deb` and `.rpm` (amd64 and arm64), macOS headless archives (arm64 and amd64), Windows amd64 headless archive, `SHA256SUMS.txt` → GitHub Release.

The same job opens a Homebrew formula pull request, updates the `apt` branch, and opens a documentation snapshot pull request. The release token cannot approve those pull requests, so a required review leaves them open and does not fail the release. Signing is not part of this workflow. The checklist is [release-checklist.md](release-checklist.md).

## Changelog and shared files

A pull request does not edit `CHANGELOG.md`. It adds a fragment under [`changes/unreleased/`](../changes/unreleased/README.md), a small Markdown file with `### Added`, `### Changed`, or `### Fixed` (and so on) and one bullet per change. Two pull requests never touch the same fragment, so they cannot conflict over the changelog. `python3 scripts/changelog.py preview` shows the next release's section; the release preparation runs `python3 scripts/changelog.py release <version>`, which writes it into `CHANGELOG.md` and removes the fragments.

Other files many pull requests touch merge cleanly when each change goes next to related lines rather than at the end of the file:

- **`api/openapi.yaml`:** add a path beside the other paths for the same area (all the `/api/v1/notifications/...` paths together), and a schema beside related schemas, not at the end of `components`.
- **`docs/user-guide/guide.json`:** change the section the feature belongs to, not the last section.
- **`web/src/types/api.ts` and `web/src/lib/api.ts`:** add a type or method beside the ones for the same feature.

## Conventions

This repository does not include an `AGENTS.md`. Match the package you are editing. Keep handlers thin and put behavior in `internal/`. Do not add license headers file by file. The project license is the root `LICENSE`.
