# API

The daemon listens on `http://127.0.0.1:7331` unless `config.json` or `TOSKAR_API_HOST` / `TOSKAR_API_PORT` say otherwise. This page lists every route and records behavior that matters when you call the server. [api/openapi.yaml](../api/openapi.yaml) describes every route below in OpenAPI 3.0. A test fails when a route is added to the daemon without it. [CLI](cli.md) and [Configuration](configuration.md) cover the command line and settings.

## Authentication

Loopback binds (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `localhost`) do not require an API key. Any other API host, including `0.0.0.0` and `::`, requires `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` on every `/api/v1/*` and `/v1/*` request from another machine. A request that arrives over loopback (`127.0.0.1` or `::1`) still needs no key, so apps on this computer keep working when network access is on. A request carrying `Forwarded`, `X-Forwarded-For`, or `X-Real-IP` came through a proxy and is treated as coming from the network. The daemon refuses to listen on a non-loopback address until at least one API key exists. `GET /about` and `GET /source` stay open so a network user can obtain the corresponding source.

The web UI calls this setting local network access. Turning it on stores `api_host` as `0.0.0.0`, turns the key check on, and moves the API to that address at once, with no restart. Turning it off moves it back to `127.0.0.1` and closes connections from other devices; a request from another device after that is refused with `403` `LAN_ACCESS_OFF`. If the new address can't be bound, the setting stays as it was and the change returns an error. The daemon also rejects a settings change that enables that bind when no key exists. The computer's discovery record (Bonjour) carries `api_lan=true` or `false`, so an app that finds it can tell an API it can reach from one that answers only on that computer.

Create a key from the web UI or `POST /api/v1/api-keys`. The response includes the secret once. The database stores a bcrypt hash and a prefix. The plaintext key is not written to disk. Revoke with `DELETE /api/v1/api-keys/{id}` and rotate with `POST /api/v1/api-keys/{id}/rotate`. Do not put the key in a URL or query string. Those requests are rejected.

### Connecting a phone

A phone gets its own key with a 6-digit code instead of a copied secret:

1. **The computer shows a code.** Its own UI calls `POST /api/v1/devices/pairing`, which returns `code`, `expires_at` (10 minutes on), `address` (where a phone reaches this computer, such as `192.168.1.20:7331`), and `reachable` (false while the API answers only on this computer). With `{"enable_lan": true}` it first turns on local network access, without the key that setting otherwise needs, since pairing makes the phone's key; if no phone or key ever uses it, the next start turns it off again instead of refusing to start. A new code replaces the last one. `GET /api/v1/devices/pairing` returns the same without the code, plus `state` (`waiting`, `connected`, `expired`, or `cancelled`) and `device`, the key a phone connected with. `DELETE` stops showing the code.
2. **The phone sends it.** `POST /api/v1/devices/pair` with `{"code": "123456", "device_name": "Sam's iPhone"}` needs no key. It answers `201` with `api_key`, shown once, and `key`, its record, named after the phone, with `kind` `device`.

Rules for the exchange:
- **Local network only:** the exchange answers only from this computer's network (private, link-local, and 100.64/10 addresses). A request through a proxy (`Forwarded`, `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Real-IP`) is refused with `PAIRING_NOT_LOCAL`.
- **Single use:** a code works once.
- **Wrong codes:** five wrong codes cancel it (`PAIRING_WRONG_CODE`, then `PAIRING_NOT_STARTED`).
- **Too many tries:** an address gets ten tries in ten minutes (`PAIRING_THROTTLED`, `429`).
- **Expiry:** an expired code returns `PAIRING_EXPIRED` (`410`).

Only the code's hash is kept, in memory, so restarting the daemon ends it.

A phone's key reaches only what the phone uses:
- chat and Stop;
- conversations and their messages, including renaming and deleting them;
- live events;
- answering a tool's question;
- the chat's files;
- read-only lists: health, version, settings, profiles, models, running models, and computers;
- warming a chat's model;
- automations: listing them, one with its runs, Run now, Pause, Resume, and opening a run's result in chat (not making, editing, or deleting one);
- notifications: listing them, one by id, marking them read, and dismissing one;
- memory: listing, changing (turning off, This computer only), and deleting memories;
- personalization: reading and changing it;
- what left this computer (`GET /egress`) and the privacy overview (`GET /privacy`), read-only;
- adding a knowledge source from text or a file (`POST /knowledge/sources`), for the share sheet.

The person's role still applies, so a Member's phone gets `403` for what left the computer and for adding knowledge.

Anything else returns `403` `DEVICE_NOT_ALLOWED`. It appears in `GET /api-keys` with `kind` `device`, keeps that kind when rotated, and is revoked like any other key. Over plain HTTP the code and the key can be read by others on the same network, as any key can.

`TOSKAR_API_KEY`, when set, is hashed at startup if that secret is not already valid. The Docker image binds `0.0.0.0` and will not start until that variable is set or a key is already in the data directory. The cluster compose file sets a local test key for that reason.

A bearer token on plain HTTP does not encrypt traffic; use HTTPS on the same port from other devices (see below).

### People

Toskar is getting people and roles (#206). Today there is one person, the **Owner**, and everything belongs to them: API keys, chats, memories, files, and automations each record their person (`person_id`, `owner` for everything from before). Roles, from the most to the least: `owner`, `admin`, `member`, and `visitor`.

Every `/api/v1` request is known to be someone's: one from this computer, or answered without a key while the API listens only here, is the Owner's (`via: this_computer`); one with an API key is the key's person's (`via: api_key`), and stops working if that person is disabled. `GET /api/v1/me` returns the request's `person` (`id`, `name`, `username`, `role`), `via`, and `key_id`. `/v1/chat/completions` and MCP calls are their key's person's too.

Chats and their messages, memories, files, and automations are private to their person: lists, reads, changes, and deletes reach only the request's own, even for the Owner, and "delete all chats" deletes only theirs. A chat's turn draws only on its person's memories. An automation runs as its person, so its chat, memories, and files are theirs, and a disabled person's automations don't run; the scheduler itself finds what's due across everyone. Knowledge sources, profiles, models, tools, and settings are shared.

**Signing in.** Admins and the Owner add people with `POST /api/v1/people` (`name`, `role`: an Admin adds Members and Visitors, the Owner adds Admins too). The answer has a one-time `link` (`path` `/invite/<token>`, a week to use): opening it, the person chooses a username and password (`GET` and `POST /api/v1/invites/{token}`), and their browser is signed in. Later, `POST /api/v1/people/{id}/link` makes a reset link (a day to use) for a new password, which signs them out everywhere else. The Owner, who uses this computer without signing in, makes a link for themselves the same way to sign in from other devices.
- **Sessions:** `POST /api/v1/session` (`username`, `password`) sets an HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax `toskar_session` cookie (Secure over HTTPS), good for 30 days from its last use; `DELETE /api/v1/session` signs out. Only a SHA-256 of the cookie is stored. A signed-in browser's change (anything but GET) must come from Toskar's own pages: browsers send `Origin` or `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin`, and a change without either answers `403 CROSS_SITE`.
- **Who a request is:** a valid API key's person first, then a signed-in browser's, then, from this computer or while the API listens only here, the Owner. A wrong key from this computer is ignored, as before.
- **Passwords:** at least 10 characters, hashed with argon2id (19 MiB, 2 passes). A wrong username and a wrong password take the same time and say the same: `SIGN_IN_FAILED`. Five misses for a username in 15 minutes, or twenty from an address in 10, answer `429 SIGN_IN_THROTTLED`.
- **Sign-in with OpenID Connect:** set `oidc` in `config.json` (`issuer`, `client_id`, and optionally `redirect_url`, `scopes`, `groups_claim`, `admin_groups`, `member_groups`, `default_role`, `owner_email`, `owner_subject`, `label`), or `TOSKAR_OIDC_*`. The client secret is never kept there: it comes from `TOSKAR_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` or the file `client_secret_file` names. Register `<Toskar's address>/api/v1/oidc/callback` with the provider. `GET /api/v1/oidc` says whether it's offered, with the button's `label`; `GET /api/v1/oidc/start?return=/path` sends the browser to the provider (authorization code with PKCE, and the state in a 10-minute `toskar_oidc` cookie), and `GET /api/v1/oidc/callback` checks the state against that cookie, swaps the code for an ID token at the token endpoint, checks its signature against the provider's keys (RS256/384/512, ES256/384/512) with its issuer, audience, expiry, and nonce, and signs the browser in with an ordinary session before returning to the path. The person is found by the provider's subject, made the first time, and given a role from their groups like the proxy's; the Owner is `owner_subject`, or `owner_email` when the provider says it's verified. A failure returns to `/?oidc_error=` `failed`, `refused`, `disabled`, or `unavailable`. Settings that can't work stop Toskar from starting.
- **Sign-in by a reverse proxy:** behind Authelia, Authentik, Cloudflare Access, Tailscale, or another proxy that signs people in, list the proxy in `trusted_proxies` (IPs or CIDRs in `config.json`, or `TOSKAR_TRUSTED_PROXIES`). A request whose connection comes from a listed address names its person in `Remote-User`, with `Remote-Name` and `Remote-Groups` (separated by `,` or `|`); `proxy_auth` renames them (`user_header`, `name_header`, `groups_header`, or `TOSKAR_PROXY_USER_HEADER` and so on). The person is found by that name, made the first time, and given a role from their groups each time: `admin_groups` make an Admin, `member_groups` a Member, and everyone else gets `default_role` (`member`, `visitor`, or `none` to refuse them with `403 PROXY_REFUSED`). `owner_user` is the proxy's name for the Owner. The headers mean nothing from any other address, however a request says it was forwarded, and a request through the proxy that names nobody is never this computer's Owner, though the proxy runs here. A trusted proxy's host name and `X-Forwarded-Host` are accepted as Toskar's own. `GET /me` says `via: proxy`. With the proxy on this computer (`127.0.0.1`), every request from here counts as the proxy's, so open Toskar through the proxy too, or send an API key; this is for servers, not the desktop app. An address that isn't an IP or CIDR, or another `default_role`, stops Toskar from starting.
- **Changing people:** `PATCH /api/v1/people/{id}` (`name`, `role`, `disabled`). The Owner's role is fixed and they can't be disabled; nobody changes their own role or disables themselves; an Admin changes Members and Visitors only. Disabling signs the person out everywhere and stops their keys and automations.
- **Phones:** a phone paired with a code gets the key of the person who showed the code.
- **Network access:** turning on `lan_api_enabled` needs an API key, trusted proxies, an OpenID Connect provider, or a person other than the Owner who isn't disabled, since they sign in with a password or still have a link to; otherwise it answers `API_KEY_REQUIRED`. The app's People page (`/people`) adds people and shows their links, and `/invite/<token>` is the page a link opens.

**Roles.** Every `/api/v1` request from a key or a signed-in browser is checked against its person's role; one that needs more answers `403 ROLE_REQUIRED` with `details.role`, the least role that may.
- **Visitors** chat: `/chat`, their conversations and their files, `/tools/decide`, `/speech`, and reading settings, profiles, models, tools, specialized AIs, and computers.
- **Members** also have their memories, automations, and notifications, and read knowledge sources and search them.
- **Admins** have everything else: models, runtimes, tools, profiles, knowledge sources, computers, keys, devices, people, settings, notifications, runs, training, performance, and diagnostics.
- **The Owner** alone erases everything (`POST /settings/reset`).
- **Your own devices:** anyone shows a code with `POST /devices/pairing` to connect their own phone, tablet, or TV, whose key is theirs; only its starter sees the code's state or cancels it, and only an Admin may pass `enable_lan`. `GET /api/v1/me/devices` lists the devices connected as the request's person, and `DELETE /api/v1/me/devices/{id}` disconnects one of them.
- **Your own preferences:** everyone keeps their own App language, assistant language, and personalization. `PATCH /api/v1/me/preferences` (`ui_locale`, `assistant_language_mode`, `assistant_language`) and `GET`/`PUT /api/v1/personalization` save the request's person's, whatever their role, and `GET /settings` shows theirs. The Owner's are the install's, which everyone else has until they choose; their answers, notices, and automations follow their own. `PATCH /settings` sets the same three for whoever sends it.
- A route not given a role needs an Admin. `/v1/chat/completions` answers any key's person; `/mcp` needs a Member. From this computer, a request without a key or session is the Owner's, as before.

### Topic controls

A profile's `topics` keep its assistant on its subject (#345; see [topic-controls.md](topic-controls.md)): `stays_on` (required, up to 1000 characters), `examples` and `never_discuss` (up to 20 each, 200 characters), `off_topic_reply` (up to 500, used word for word; empty has the assistant say in a sentence what it can help with), `strictness` (`guide` or `enforce`; empty is `guide`), `web_sites` (up to 20 site names, such as `example.com`; typed addresses are cut to the site), and `web_keywords` (up to 10, 50 characters each). They come first in every turn's instructions, as the administrator's rules, ahead of the person's style and memories and an API caller's system message, which can't change them. Send `topics` with `POST` or `PATCH /api/v1/profiles`; leave it out, or send an empty `stays_on`, for none. With `enforce`, each message is checked before it's answered and each answer before it's shown; an off-topic one gets the set reply instead, and the run trace's `topic` is `on_topic`, `small_talk`, `off_topic` (held before answering), or `answer_off_topic` (the answer was replaced). With `web_sites`, web searches reach only those sites and their subdomains, results elsewhere are dropped, and pages elsewhere aren't opened; `web_keywords` are added to every search. Both apply at either strictness.

`POST /api/v1/profiles/{id}/try-topics` (Admins) runs one `message` past the profile's topic controls, or draft `topics` sent in their place, for the editor's Try it panel. It answers `label` (`on_topic`, `small_talk`, `off_topic`, or empty when the check gave nothing usable), `held`, `replaced`, and `reply`. The check runs at either strictness; the answer is a quick one without tools, knowledge, or memories, and nothing is saved or recorded.

`GET /api/v1/profiles/{id}/topic-attempts?days=30` (Admins) lists what an Enforce profile held (`off_topic`) or whose answer it replaced (`answer_off_topic`): `total`, `by_day`, `by_where` (`kind` is `portal`, `key`, `person`, or `automation`, with `id`, `name`, and `count`), and the latest 100 `attempts` with their `where`. They're run records: kept and deleted with them, and `DELETE`-ing run records counts them in `topic_attempts`. `POST /api/v1/profiles/{id}/topic-attempts/{aid}/on-topic` adds that message to the profile's examples and forgets the attempts with it (`404 ATTEMPT_NOT_FOUND`, `409 EXAMPLES_FULL` at 20 examples).

### Pinning profiles

Admins pin Members and Visitors to profiles (#345): `GET /api/v1/profile-pins` answers `{"roles": {"member": [...], "visitor": [...]}}`, and `PUT /api/v1/profile-pins/{role}` with `{"profiles": [...]}` sets a role's (empty is any profile). `PUT /api/v1/people/{id}/profiles` sets one person's in place of their role's: a list, `[]` for any profile, or `null` for their role's again; a person's `profiles` shows it. The Owner and Admins can't be pinned (`400 PIN_INVALID`), and only to profiles that exist. A pinned person's turns, from the app, `/v1`, MCP, or their automations, use the profile asked for when they may use it, and otherwise their first; `GET /api/v1/me` lists the profiles they may use in `profiles`.

### Chat portals

A chat portal (#205) is a branded chat page an Admin publishes for the people they serve, answering with its own profile, tools, memory setting, and language. Its page is `/p/<slug>`: only a chat, with the portal's branding, and none of the app around it.

- **Managing portals** (Admins): `GET` and `POST /api/v1/portals`, `GET`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE /api/v1/portals/{id}`. A portal has a `slug` (its address, 2 to 40 lowercase letters, digits, or dashes), `name`, `profile_id` (empty is the default profile), `tools` (`none`, `read_only`, or `profile`; new portals start with `none`), `memory` (off to start), `language` (empty follows the visitor), `access` (`open`, `passcode`, `members`, or `invited`), a write-only `passcode` (for `passcode` access) (at least 6 characters; `has_passcode` says whether there is one), `branding` (a JSON object the page reads, under 16 KB), and `enabled`. Errors: `PORTAL_INVALID`, `PORTAL_SLUG_TAKEN`, `PORTAL_NOT_FOUND`.
- **Branding:** the page reads these fields of `branding`, each optional: `title` (the portal's name when empty), `logo_url` (an http(s) or `data:image/…;base64` address), `accent` and `background` (hex colours), `theme` (`dark`, `light`, or `system`), `welcome`, `prompts` (up to six suggested first messages), and `footer`. Anything else is ignored, and a value that isn't the right kind is left out.
- **Visitors:** `GET /api/v1/portals/{slug}/page` answers anyone with the portal's name, access, language, and branding, and whether this browser has entered. `POST /api/v1/portals/{slug}/enter` (with `passcode` when it has one; ten wrong tries per address in ten minutes, then a wait) makes the browser a *guest*: a person who belongs to the portal, hidden from People, signed in by a `toskar_portal_<slug>` cookie. That cookie counts only on requests carrying `X-Toskar-Portal: <slug>`, so it never changes who the main app is in the same browser.
- **Members only and invited:** with `members`, people signed in to this Toskar as Members and up (#206) chat on the portal's page as themselves, under its settings and limits; anyone else is refused with `403 PORTAL_MEMBERS`, and the page offers to sign in, coming back after (`/?next=/p/<slug>`). With `invited`, Admins invite visitors by name: `GET` and `POST /api/v1/portals/{id}/visitors` (`name`; the answer has `person` and a one-time `link`, `/p/<slug>?invite=<token>`, good for a week), `POST /api/v1/portals/{id}/visitors/{vid}/link` for a new link, and `DELETE /api/v1/portals/{id}/visitors/{vid}`, which disables and signs them out at once. Opening the link (`enter` with `invite`) makes the browser that visitor, also on later visits; without one, `403 PORTAL_INVITE`. A portal invitation can't be used as a sign-in link (`/invites/{token}` doesn't know it).
- **Embedding:** `embed_origins` lists the websites (origins such as `https://shop.example.com`, up to 20, no paths) that may show the portal's page in a frame; every other page Toskar serves answers `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self'`, so no other website can frame the app. `GET /embed.js` is a script that adds a chat button to the page that loads it: `<script src="<Toskar>/embed.js" data-portal="<slug>" data-label="Chat" data-color="#0f766e"></script>`. In a frame, browsers hold back the portal's cookie, so the page enters with `embed: true`, gets its `session` in the answer, and sends it as `X-Toskar-Portal-Session`.
- **The Owner's view:** `GET /api/v1/portals/{id}/conversations` lists the portal's visitors' conversations, newest first (`id`, `title`, `visitor`, `messages`, `created_at`, `updated_at`), and `GET /api/v1/portals/{id}/conversations/{cid}/messages` reads one; a Members only portal's chats are each Member's own, so they aren't there. `GET /api/v1/portals/{id}/usage` counts visitors who wrote, conversations, and messages over the last 7 and 30 days. `retention_days` (30 to start, 0 keeps them, at most 3650) deletes visitors' conversations older than that, hourly, and anonymous visitors left with none. The portal page tells visitors the people who run it can read their chats. In What left this computer, a portal's chats are `portal`.
- **Limits:** `hourly_limit` (messages each guest may send an hour, 30 to start, 0 for none, at most 1000), `max_message` (characters, 2000 to start, 100 to 20000), and `concurrency` (the portal's chats at once, 2 to start, 1 to 20). A guest's chat over them answers `400 PORTAL_TOO_LONG` (with `details.max`), `429 PORTAL_BUSY`, or `429 PORTAL_RATE`. The page view includes `max_message`. Portal chats wait for the chats of the people who use Toskar, and automations, indexing, benchmarks, and training wait for them.
- **What a guest reaches:** only the portal's chat: `/chat`, their own conversations and their files, the live events about them (and no others), a tool's question, and leaving. Anything else answers `403 PORTAL_ONLY`, however the session is sent. A guest's chat always takes the portal's profile, tools, memory, and language, whatever the request or the conversation says. Turning a portal off stops its guests at once (`403 PORTAL_OFF`); removing it disables them.

### HTTPS

The API answers HTTPS and plain HTTP on the same port (#213), told apart by the first byte of each connection. The desktop app and this computer's browser use plain HTTP over loopback; phones, browsers, and apps on the local network can use `https://` and the same port.
- **Certificate:** Toskar makes an ECDSA P-256 certificate at first start, for `localhost`, the computer's name (and `.local`), and its local network addresses, and keeps it in `secrets/api-tls.crt` and `secrets/api-tls.key` (`0600`), so its fingerprint stays the same. It's self-signed: a browser or app asks you to trust it the first time. API Access shows the start of its SHA-256 fingerprint, such as `E863-B509`, to compare with what the browser shows.
- **Your own certificate:** set `api_tls_cert` and `api_tls_key` in `config.json`, or `TOSKAR_API_TLS_CERT` and `TOSKAR_API_TLS_KEY`, to PEM files, such as one from your own certificate authority. If they can't be read, Toskar's own certificate is used, and `GET /api/v1/tls` says why in `error`.
- **`GET /api/v1/tls`:** `enabled`, `fingerprint` (`sha256:` and the hex of the certificate), `short`, `not_after`, `custom`, and `error`. Connecting a device returns the fingerprint with the phone's key (`tls_fingerprint`, `tls_short`), so the phone can keep it and check it from then on.
- **Plain HTTP:** still answered from the network for now, so phones on an older Toskar app keep working; a key on plain HTTP limits who can call the API but doesn't encrypt traffic. A later release will require HTTPS from the network.

### Browsers and websites

A website open in a browser on this computer can send requests to `127.0.0.1`, so the daemon checks two headers before anything else, on every route:

- **`Origin`**, when a browser sends one, must be the daemon's own address (its web UI), the desktop app's webview (`wails://wails`, `http://wails.localhost`), or a loopback address on the API port, such as `http://localhost:7331`. The allowed origin is echoed in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`; `*` is never sent. Other origins get `403 ORIGIN_NOT_ALLOWED`.
- **`Host`** must name this computer: `localhost`, a `.localhost` name, or a loopback IP. With local network access on, any IP is accepted, and so is a hostname on a request from another device. A hostname on a request over loopback gets `403 HOST_NOT_ALLOWED`, which stops DNS rebinding.

A request with a valid API key passes both checks, and a preflight that announces an `Authorization` header is answered for any origin. Clients that are not browsers, such as `toskarctl` and `curl`, send no `Origin` and are unaffected. A reverse proxy on this computer must keep a loopback `Host` or send a key.

Bifrost, on port 7332, is a separate server. Its protected routes require a paired-node token. Pairing routes answer before trust exists; they check signatures and limit attempts. See [clustering.md](clustering.md).

## Corresponding source

`GET /about` and `GET /source` return the same JSON and do not require an API key:

```json
{
  "name": "Toskar Core",
  "version": "1.4.0",
  "commit": "abc1234",
  "license": "AGPL-3.0-or-later",
  "source": "https://github.com/yeixio/toskar-core/tree/v1.4.0"
}
```

`GET /api/v1/version` includes `license` and `source` as well. The Settings page links to that source URL.

A release build, which sets `version.Version` from the tag, points `source` at `https://github.com/yeixio/toskar-core/tree/v<version>`. A development build with a known commit points at `.../tree/<commit>`. A build with neither points at the repository itself.

If you distribute or operate a modified Toskar Core over a network, set the source URL so users can obtain the corresponding source for your modified version:

```text
-X github.com/yeixio/toskar-core/internal/version.SourceURL=<url-of-your-corresponding-source>
```

The same text is printed by `toskar -version` and by `toskarctl version` or `toskarctl about`.

## Route reference

Control-plane routes are under `/api/v1`. The OpenAI-compatible routes are under `/v1`, and Toskar's MCP server is `/mcp` (see [MCP](mcp.md)). `GET /about` and `GET /source` are at the root.

### System

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/health` | The process is up, and `acceleration`: where the loaded models run (`gpu`, `partial`, `cpu`, `cpu_expected`, or `idle`) |
| GET | `/version` | Version, commit, license, corresponding source, and client `contract` |
| GET | `/hardware` | This computer's CPU, memory, disk, and accelerators |
| GET, PATCH | `/settings` | Read or change settings (see [Configuration](configuration.md#settings)). `PUT` is accepted as `PATCH`. |
| POST | `/settings/reset` | Clear application state; `delete_models=true` also removes model files |
| GET, POST | `/diagnostics` | Build the diagnostic bundle, which omits secrets. `?include_conversations=true` adds chats. |
| GET | `/diagnostics/runtime` | The daemon's memory (`heap_bytes`, `sys_bytes`) and goroutines `now` and in `samples` taken every `interval_seconds` (five minutes) for the last day, oldest first, since `started_at`. The Diagnostics page charts it. |
| GET | `/logs` | Log files. `GET /logs/{name}` returns one; `?tail_bytes=` limits it to the end. |
| GET | `/events` | Server-sent event stream (see [Events](#events)) |
| GET | `/capabilities` | The capability inventory. `?ask=` returns the abilities a question is about. `GET /capabilities/models/{id}` says which computers can run a model. |
| GET | `/caches` | Every cache with its policy and counts. `POST /caches/{name}/clear` clears one. |
| GET | `/performance` | Recent generation runs with timings. `?sort=`, `?order=`, `?limit=` |

### Chat

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/chat` | Send a message through a profile. Takes `conversation_id`, `message`, `profile_id`, `model_id` (`auto` for Auto), `effort`, `attachments` (artifact ids), `execution` (where it runs), `time_zone` (the person's IANA time zone, such as `America/Juneau`; the app sends the browser's), and `stream`. Every turn is told the current date and time in that zone, or this computer's when it is empty or unknown; an automation's run uses its schedule's zone. Progress arrives on `/events`. |
| POST | `/chat/stop` | Stop a conversation's running turn: `{"conversation_id": "..."}` returns `{"stopped": true}` when one was running |
| GET, POST | `/conversations` | List or create chats |
| PATCH, DELETE | `/conversations/{id}` | Change a chat's `title`, `profile_id`, `model_id`, or `memory_off`, or delete it with its files |
| POST | `/conversations/delete` | Delete several chats at once, with their messages and files (#452, contract 1.25): `{"ids": [...]}`, 1 to 1,000. Answers `{"deleted": [...], "skipped": [{"id", "reason"}]}`; a chat that isn't the caller's, or doesn't exist, is skipped as `not_found`. Allowed wherever a single delete is: people, paired devices, and portal guests, each for their own chats. `INVALID_CONVERSATION_IDS` for none or too many |
| GET | `/conversations/{id}/messages` | A chat's messages as shown, with each answer's `meta` and, where a retry or an edit made more than one, `versions` |
| PUT | `/conversations/{id}/messages/{mid}/shown` | Show that version of its point, with what followed it; answers with the chat as shown |
| GET | `/conversations/{id}/artifacts` | Files attached to or made in a chat |
| POST | `/artifacts` | Upload a file to attach: `name` plus `text`, or `content_base64` for binary files. Until it is sent with a message, it has an `expires_at` |
| GET, POST, DELETE | `/images/setup` | Image generation: what is installed and the models on offer, start setting up a model (`model_id`) in the background, or stop the setup. Poll `GET` for its progress. `?node_id=` does the same on a paired computer (#153), whose status adds `free_bytes`; a computer running an older Toskar answers `SETUP_REFUSED` saying it needs a newer one. |
| DELETE | `/images/models/{id}` | Delete an installed image model |
| GET, POST, DELETE | `/video/setup` | Video generation, the same way: status, start setting up a model (`model_id`), or stop, here or with `?node_id=` |
| DELETE | `/video/models/{id}` | Delete an installed video model |
| GET, DELETE | `/artifacts/{id}` | A file's details, or delete it. `GET /artifacts/{id}/content` returns the bytes as a download. |
| GET, POST | `/memory` | Memories (Muninn). GET returns `memories` and `categories`. |
| PATCH, DELETE | `/memory/{id}` | Change a memory's `content`, `category`, `enabled`, or `local_only`, or delete it |
| GET, PUT | `/personalization` | How answers should look: `length`, `tone`, `format`, `units`, `about_me`, `instructions` |
| GET | `/runs` | Run traces, newest first. `?conversation_id=`, `?limit=`. `GET /runs/{id}` returns one. |
| GET, POST | `/tasks` | Orchestration tasks. `GET /tasks/{id}` returns one with its steps. |

### Models and runtimes

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/models` | The catalog and installed models, with `support_role` and fit |
| GET | `/models/fit` | How well each catalog model fits each computer |
| GET | `/models/recommend` | A recommended setup. `?purpose=` (`general`, `coding`, `research`) |
| GET | `/models/browse` | Search Hugging Face GGUF models. `?q=`, `?limit=`. A repository with a vision projector (an `mmproj` file) is tagged `vision` |
| POST | `/models/{id}/install` | Install a catalog model |
| POST | `/models/install-from-url` | Install a GGUF from a URL. For a Hugging Face `resolve` URL, the daemon reads the repository's file list: the download is checked against the file's SHA-256, and a vision model's projector from the same folder (full precision first) downloads with it, so the model can see pictures. The projector is never taken from the request |
| POST | `/models/import` | Add a model from a GGUF file (#467): `{"path", "in_place", "id", "display_name", "tags"}` for a file on this computer, or the file itself as an `application/octet-stream` body with `filename` (and optionally `display_name`, `id`) in the query. The header is read and every tensor checked to lie inside the file before anything is added, so an incomplete copy, a file that isn't GGUF, or a vision projector (`MODEL_FILE_INVALID`, `MODEL_FILE_PROJECTOR`) is refused. By default the file is copied into the models folder in the background, with `model.download` progress events, and the original can be deleted; with `in_place` it's used where it is, and deleting the model leaves the file. The name, architecture, quantization, context length, and parameter count come from the header. Answers `model_id`, `status` (`copying` or `installed`), and `details` |
| GET | `/models/import/found` | Models other local AI apps already downloaded on this computer (#467): LM Studio (`~/.lmstudio/models`), Ollama (its manifests name each `model:tag`'s blob; `OLLAMA_MODELS` moves the folder), llama.cpp's cache, and GPT4All, each with `app`, `path`, `name`, `size_bytes`, `architecture`, `parameters`, `quantization`, and `model_id` when it's already a model here. Only headers and manifests are read; incomplete files and vision projectors are left out. Add one with `POST /models/import` and its `path`, usually `in_place`: an Ollama blob has no `.gguf` name, and is accepted because it's listed here. An app sandboxed away from these folders finds nothing |
| PATCH | `/models/{id}` | Rename or retag a model added from a file or a link (#467): `display_name` (1 to 120 characters) and `tags` (`general`, `coding`, `reasoning`, `writing`; Auto sends coding requests to one tagged `coding`). A catalog model answers `MODEL_NOT_EDITABLE` |
| PUT | `/models/{id}/projector` | Give an installed model its vision projector, `{"path"}` to a GGUF `mmproj` on this computer, copied beside the model, so it can see pictures and is tagged `vision`. A path import's answer offers one found beside the file as `projector`, and `/models/import/found` lists each model's `projector` when its app keeps one (Ollama's projector layer, or an `mmproj` file in the same folder). `MODEL_FILE_NOT_PROJECTOR` for a model file |
| DELETE | `/models/{id}` | Remove an installed model |
| POST | `/models/{id}/start`, `/models/{id}/stop` | Load or unload a model |
| GET | `/diagnostics/gpu` | What this computer still needs for Toskar to use its GPU: each missing piece (`vulkan_loader_missing`, `vulkan_driver_missing`, `render_access_denied`, `nvidia_driver_missing`, `windows_driver_missing`, `cpu_build`) with a fix `command` written for this computer, or a `url` |
| GET | `/performance/live` | Live CPU, memory, and GPU figures for this and paired computers: now, the last hour, and per-minute averages for the day (see [GPU acceleration](#gpu-acceleration)) |
| GET | `/models/running` | Loaded models, with `mode` (`embedding` or `reranking` for supporting models), `speed_tok_per_sec` from their latest replies, and `acceleration`: where each runs (see [GPU acceleration](#gpu-acceleration)) |
| POST | `/models/warm` | Start loading the model a chat would use, and answer at once (#498, contract 1.26), so it loads while someone types or speaks. Takes `profile_id` (empty: the default profile) and `model_id` (empty or `auto`: what Auto would pick for a general chat, the profile's fast model first). Answers `{"model_id", "status"}`: `loading`, `loaded`, `busy` (a model is answering, so nothing new loads), `no_room` (it wouldn't fit beside the loaded models), `not_local` (not installed on this computer), or `none`. Paired devices and everyone who may chat can call it |
| GET, PUT, DELETE | `/models/{id}/rating` | This person's 1–5 star rating of a model, and exactly what sharing it would send. See [Community ratings](#community-ratings). |
| POST | `/models/{id}/rating/dismiss` | Stop asking for a rating of a model |
| GET | `/ratings/community` | Everyone's ratings of the models here, from hardware like this computer's, overall, and by language |
| GET | `/runtimes` | Runtimes and their detection |
| GET, PUT | `/external-server` | The external OpenAI-compatible server: `base_url`, `has_key`, and its `models`; PUT takes `base_url`, `api_key`, and `clear_key` |
| POST | `/runtimes/{id}/install` | Install a runtime (`llamacpp`) |

### Profiles and tools

| POST | `/profiles/{id}/reset` | Put a built-in profile back to how Toskar ships it. Other profiles are refused with 400 |
| GET | `/tools` | Every tool's descriptor (level, input schema, outputs, requirements, time limit, provider), with whether it is enabled, its `health`, and the profiles that allow it |
| GET | `/tools/{id}` | One tool's descriptor |
| GET | `/tools/runs` | Audited tool calls, newest first; `?tool_id=`, `?conversation_id=`, `?limit=` |
| POST | `/tools/{id}/enabled` | Turn a tool on or off everywhere |

| GET | `/tools/providers` | Each computer's providers for image and speech tools, which can run on any paired computer: state (healthy, installing, failed, unavailable), what runs it, whether a GPU does the work, and the `languages` it works in (`auto_detect` when it tells the language itself) |
| GET | `/connectors` | Connected services and their status |
| PUT, DELETE | `/connectors/{id}` | Connect a service (`{"values": {...}}`), or disconnect it. `POST /connectors/{id}/check` tests the stored credential. |

| GET | `/mcp/servers/{id}/logs`, `/prompts`, `/resources` | A source's log, prompts, and resources. `POST /mcp/servers/{id}/prompts/{name}` fills in a prompt. |
| GET | `/mcp/gallery` | Known MCP servers to add |
| GET | `/mcp/import` | MCP servers set up in other apps on this computer, with secrets hidden |
| POST | `/mcp/parse` | Read pasted MCP configuration into sources, and what each still needs |
| GET | `/mcp/share` | What other apps need to use Toskar over MCP: `url`, `command`, `args`, `needs_key` |

### Knowledge

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET, POST | `/knowledge/sources` | Connected knowledge (Mimir), or add a source: `kind` `path`, `text`, `database`, or `api`; `profile_ids` adds it to those profiles too, since a chat searches only its profile's sources |
| GET, PATCH, DELETE | `/knowledge/sources/{id}` | Read, change (`name`, `text`, `local_only`, `remote`), or remove a source |
| POST | `/knowledge/sources/{id}/refresh` | Reindex now |
| GET | `/knowledge/sources/{id}/content` | The copy kept for a pasted or uploaded source |
| POST | `/knowledge/search` | Passages that match a question |

Uploads send `text`, or `content_base64` for binary files such as `.xlsx` and `.pdf`. The same field works for `/training/classify` and `/training/ais/{id}/materials`.

| GET | `/training/ais/{id}/plan` | What trains, what stays connected, and the training fit per computer |
| POST | `/training/ais/{id}/train` | Start a training job; an optional `{"node_id": "..."}` picks the computer |
| GET | `/training/jobs` | Training jobs. `GET /training/jobs/{id}` returns one; `POST /training/jobs/{id}/cancel` cancels it. |
| PUT | `/training/ais/{id}/test-prompts` | Replace the test set |
| POST | `/training/ais/{id}/revisions/{n}/evaluate` | Compare base and specialized answers |

| POST | `/automations/parse` | Read a request such as "every morning at 8, tell me if the price is below $500" into an automation to review |
| GET | `/notifications` | The notification center: `{"notifications": [...], "unread": n}`. `?unread=1` lists unread ones; `?category=` lists one category. Each person sees their own: automation results and approval requests are their person's alone, and Admins and the Owner also see notices about the install (models, training, health, system). Desktop notices, email, push, and webhooks carry the install's notices and the Owner's own, never another person's (#206). |

| PUT | `/api-keys/{id}/permissions` | Set what requests with the key may use |
| POST, GET, DELETE | `/devices/pairing` | Show a code a phone connects with, see whether one has, or stop ([Connecting a phone](#connecting-a-phone)) |
| POST | `/devices/pair` | A phone exchanges the code for its own key; no key needed, local network only |

| GET | `/benchmarks/{id}` | One benchmark. `POST /benchmarks/{id}/cancel` stops it. |

## Chat turns

### Access from anywhere

The listener for paired devices away from home (#456; design in [remote-access.md](remote-access.md)). It's off until an Admin turns it on with `PATCH /settings` `{"remote_access_enabled": true}`; `remote_access_port` sets its port (1024 to 65535, not the API's or the computers'; 0 is 7333), and `remote_access_address` is where a port forwarded by hand is reached from outside (a host name or IP, with a port when it differs). It listens on every address, over HTTPS only, with the API's certificate, so a phone's pin holds. It serves only the routes a phone's key reaches: any other key gets `403 REMOTE_DEVICES_ONLY`, a request with no key or a wrong one gets `401`, and after twenty wrong keys from an address in ten minutes that address gets `429 REMOTE_THROTTLED`. Nothing there is ever this computer's or the local network's: no sign-in, no pairing, no pages. Turning it off closes it and its connections at once. While it's on and no forwarded address is set, Toskar asks the router to open the port (PCP, then NAT-PMP, then UPnP-IGD), renews the mapping before it lapses, and removes it when access from anywhere is turned off or Toskar quits; `remote_access_port_mapping: false` stops that. `GET /remote-access` (Admins) answers `enabled`, `port`, `address`, `listening` (the address it listens on) or `error`, `port_mapping`, `mapped` (the router's outside address and port) with `mapped_by` (`pcp`, `nat-pmp`, or `upnp`), `map_error`, `ipv6` (this computer's global IPv6 addresses), and `reachable`: `direct` (a router port at a public address), `ipv6`, `manual` (a forwarded address), or `none` with `reason` (`off`, `not_listening`, `carrier_nat` when the router's own outside address isn't public, or `no_port`). **The route secret** finds the computer away from home without the rendezvous learning its addresses: pairing (`POST /devices/pair`) now also answers `route_secret` (32 bytes, base64url), `route_id` (derived from it), and `relay` (the relay this computer uses: Toskar's `relay.toskar.ai:4443`, or an organization's own), and a device paired before gets them with `GET /remote-access/route`, on the home network only and never through the remote listener (`403 ROUTE_NOT_LOCAL`). Both also answer `token`, the computer's current token for Toskar's relay, when it has one (contract 1.27), so every paired device, not only the one that subscribed, can look the computer up away from home; a computer on an organization's relay doesn't send it. The route ID is HKDF-SHA256 of the secret with info `toskar route id`, 20 bytes as lowercase base32; the record key is HKDF with `toskar route key`, 32 bytes. The address record (`internal/rendezvous`) is JSON `{payload, cert, alg, sig}`, where `payload` is `{v: 1, route, at, addresses}` signed with the API certificate's key (`ecdsa-sha256`, `rsa-pkcs1-sha256`, or `ed25519`), sealed with AES-256-GCM under the record key, the route ID as additional data and a 12-byte nonce in front. A device opens it, checks that the SHA-256 of `cert` is its pin and that the signature holds, and drops records older than it allows. Settings errors: `REMOTE_PORT_INVALID`, `REMOTE_ADDRESS_INVALID`, and `REMOTE_LISTEN_FAILED` (with `port`) when the port can't be had, in which case the setting stays as it was.

**The relay.** While access from anywhere is on, the computer also uses a relay (toskar-relay; its protocol is in that repository's `docs/protocol.md`): Toskar's, or an organization's own, set with `remote_access_relay` (a host name, with a port when it isn't 443; empty is Toskar's, or `TOSKAR_RELAY_URL`). With a token, it registers the sealed address record every 5 minutes (the direct ways in, best first, then the relay's `<route>.<relay>:<port>`) and keeps a tunnel open; each device the relay passes along reaches the remote listener as a direct one does, with its own address for the wrong-key limit. A token comes from enrolling: `remote_access_relay_secret` is the relay's enrollment secret, kept in the secret store (`secrets/relay-enroll-secret`), never shown (settings answer `remote_access_relay_enrolled`), and traded for a 30-day token that's renewed a week before it runs out; changing the relay or the secret drops the old token. Without a token, there's no registration and no tunnel (`state: no_token`). `GET /remote-access` adds `relay` (`name`, `state`, `error`), and `reachable` is `relay` when the tunnel is up and nothing direct reaches the computer. **A subscription's token:** with Toskar's relay, the token comes from the app, which exchanges a store receipt for one for this computer's route and hands it over with `PUT /remote-access/relay-token` `{"token": "rt1.…", "enable": true}`. A paired device may send it, from home or through the remote listener; the token must be for this computer's route and not expired (`RELAY_TOKEN_INVALID`), and it's refused while an organization's relay is set (`RELAY_TOKEN_NOT_NEEDED`). `enable` also turns access from anywhere on and needs an Admin (`403 ROLE_REQUIRED`); without it, the token waits until an Admin turns it on. The answer is `{"state"}`, the relay client's state or `off`. Errors: `RELAY_INVALID`, `RELAY_SECRET_INVALID`.

### Retry and edit

Retrying an answer or editing a message adds a **version** of that point in the chat, rather than replacing it (#447). Each message has a `parent_id`, the message it follows. Messages with the same parent are versions of one point. `GET /conversations/{id}/messages` returns the chat as shown: at each point the version shown (the latest, unless another was chosen), with `versions` (`index` from 1, `count`, and the `ids` oldest first) where there's more than one. A client that ignores both fields sees the chat as a straight list. `POST /chat` takes one of:

- `retry_of`: an answer's ID. Its question is asked again from there; `message` can be left empty. The new answer is a version beside the old one.
- `edit_of`: a sent message's ID. `message` is sent in its place, as a version beside it, and answered.
- `parent_id`: any message's ID, to answer from that point.

The model is sent only the chat up to that point. When the answer a retry or an edit replaces had acted (wrote or made a file, ran a command, used Git), the new answer's `meta.notice` says that isn't undone. `PUT /conversations/{id}/messages/{mid}/shown` shows another version, and the conversation that followed it. Errors: `MESSAGE_NOT_FOUND`, and `INVALID_BRANCH` for more than one of the three or no `conversation_id`.

Assistant messages from `GET /conversations/{id}/messages` carry `meta`: the `sources` an answer drew on (`web`, `knowledge`, or `file`, with title, URL or source name, and a snippet) and plain-language `steps` describing what was done. The same `meta` is on the `chat.complete` event.

`POST /chat` takes `attachments`, a list of artifact ids. Chat reads documents, spreadsheets (`.csv`, `.tsv`, `.xlsx`), PDFs with a text layer, JSON, HTML, and code files, and shows pictures and videos to a model that can see. A scanned PDF attached to a chat is refused with a pointer to the Knowledge page, which reads scanned pages once with text recognition, instead of on every turn. An attached file reaches the model as data in the user turn, the whole file when it fits and otherwise the parts that best match the question, and files attached or produced earlier in the chat add the passages that match later questions. The user message's `meta.files` lists its attachments.

A file that belongs to no chat expires a week after it was made: one made by an automation run, by `/v1/chat/completions` or an MCP client (listed in `toskar.files`), or an upload never sent with a message. Its record has `expires_at`, and a daily sweep removes it, whatever the run record setting. Sending an upload with a message files it under the chat, where it stays until the chat is deleted.

Pictures (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.bmp`) are shown to a model that can see: a vision model, such as Gemma 3 4B or Qwen 2.5 VL 7B, installed with its projector, which the model's download includes.
- **Which model:** a message with pictures is answered by the chat's model when it can see them, and otherwise by the largest installed vision model that fits this computer's memory. A `chat.model_routed` event says so. The answer runs on this computer, in one reply without plan steps or a web look-up first.
- **Follow-ups:** a message without pictures of its own is shown the pictures attached to the message before it, so "and the one on the left?" works. After that, the chat goes back to its own model.
- **Videos** (`.mp4`, `.mov`, `.m4v`, `.webm`, `.mkv`): the model is shown 6 frames sampled evenly through the clip, with the time of each and the clip's length, and is told to call `speech.transcribe` for what's said when it has sound. Frames are read with PyAV in the speech environment, which is installed the first time if it isn't yet, so a copy without speech (the sandboxed App Store build without it) treats videos as unseen. A step reads "Watched walk.mp4". The last few videos' frames are kept in memory for follow-ups.
- **Limits:** up to 8 pictures a message, counting video frames, and 2 videos; each picture is estimated at 768 tokens of the window.
- **No vision model:** the model is told it can't see the picture, and `meta.notice` says to install a vision model on the Models page.

The `files.create` tool, allowed by default in the built-in profiles, saves a file the user can download: a document, JSON, a spreadsheet (`.xlsx` is built from CSV text), or code. It writes only to Toskar's file store. When a message asks for a file and the profile allows `files.create` without asking, Toskar has the model write only the contents and saves the file itself, with a `chat.making_file` event. The answer's `meta.files` lists produced files: from `files.create`, and from every tool that makes one, such as a picture, a clip, audio read aloud, files code saved, or a page's screenshot.

Pictures and clips work the same way. A message that asks for an image ("draw a dog", "are you able to make a picture of a dog for me?"), a change to an attached image ("make it night"), or a short video doesn't depend on the model choosing the tool, because a small model often says it can't.
- **How it's made:** when the profile doesn't deny the tool, the model writes only what to make, in English, and Toskar calls `image.generate`, `image.edit`, or `video.generate`, with a `chat.making_media` event. The model then says in the person's language that it's attached. If the model writes nothing usable, the person's own words are used.
- **What doesn't count:** a question about the ability ("can you make images?"), a how-to, or a request to find, describe, or download pictures.
- **Before setup:** a request for a picture before image generation is set up, including one asked as a question, gets the setup offer with the request, so the card finishes it once the model is ready. File content is served as an attachment with a sandboxing `Content-Security-Policy`, so HTML never runs on the API's origin.
- **Computers that can't really run it:**
  - **Too little memory:** a computer with less memory than a model's files plus 2 GB isn't offered that model, can't set it up, and isn't asked to run it. The setup and the tool say how much it needs and how much the computer has, and that a paired computer with more memory can make it. The setup status's models carry `too_little_memory`.
  - **Tight memory:** one below the memory the model is comfortable with (`memory_bytes`) is allowed, with a warning that it may be slow or fail (`tight_memory`).
  - **No GPU:** the setup status says `accelerated`, from the installed build (`build`: `metal`, `vulkan`, or `cpu`), or the one setup would install. `gpu_build` is the GPU build this computer can use, if any: Metal on a Mac, and Vulkan on Linux and Windows with a GPU that has a Vulkan driver. On the CPU build, a picture takes minutes and a clip can take most of an hour.
  - **Switching builds:** `POST /images/setup/build` (or `/video/setup/build`) with `{"build": "gpu"}` or `{"build": "cpu"}` switches, installing the build when needed; images and video share it. A Vulkan build that can't start on the GPU falls back to the CPU build by itself, and stays there. See [GPU acceleration](gpu.md).
  - **Saying so:** a setup offer carries `slow` and `tight_memory`, the offer's reply says so, and `chat.making_media` carries `slow` so the app says it takes a while.

When a model under 4B parameters answers from attached files or connected knowledge, `meta.notice` says it can mix up numbers and details and suggests a larger model. Auto treats a question about the user's files or knowledge as one that needs a careful answer, so it prefers a larger model that fits.

### Auto and specialized AIs

A chat whose `model_id` is `auto` gets an installed model chosen for each message. The message is classified as a quick question, current information, coding, a detailed question, or a task on this computer. Auto then picks the largest suitable model that fits this computer's memory, keeps a quick question on a model that is already loaded, requires tool calling for current information and tasks, and skips a model that failed in the last 10 minutes. The `chat.model_routed` event carries `model_id`, `model_name`, and a plain-language `reason`, and the reason is the first of the answer's `steps`.

The answer's language is one of Auto's inputs (multilingual spec §15–16). It is the language the answer is written in (see Answer language), and at each of Auto's steps a model whose `languages` rate it higher comes before a larger one: excellent, then good, then fair or unrated, then a model whose levels leave the language out or call it limited. A model without language levels is never left out. A loaded model keeps a quick question only when nothing that fits writes the language better. When the model Auto picks is weak in the language and nothing installed that fits does better, the answer is still written in the language and its `notice` says so, in the App language.

Community ratings and load are Auto's other inputs (spec §13):
- **Ratings:** with community ratings on, a model whose signal (see Community ratings) is at least 0.5 better comes before a larger one; closer than that, size decides. Language still comes first, and ratings never make a model that doesn't fit, or can't use tools when the request needs them, the choice. Only the summary already kept is read. When ratings changed the pick, the reason says so, such as "…, rated higher on computers like yours".
- **Load:** a model already answering something on this computer gives way to a loaded, idle model that writes the language as well, is at least half its size, and isn't rated clearly worse ("…, since Qwen 2.5 14B was busy"). A quick question takes an idle loaded model before a busy one.
- **Busy computers:** placement counts the turns this computer has streaming on each computer, and an idle computer with the model comes before a busy one. Work other computers send to a paired computer isn't counted.

Before choosing a model, Auto checks the deployed specialized AIs. A chat goes to one when the message names it, or when at least two of the message's words, and at least 40% of them, are words the AI was trained on. Those words come from its name, its goal, and words that recur in its training questions. Requests that need current information, a task on this computer, or code never go to a specialized AI, because it answers without tools. An AI whose adapter file is missing on this computer, or whose base model is not installed, is skipped. Asking for it by id then fails with an explanation. When Auto routes to a specialized AI, `chat.model_routed` carries its `sai:` id and name.

A model can have a `support_role`: `embedding`, `reranker`, or `classifier`. These models serve Toskar instead of chatting. The role comes from the catalog, or, for models installed by URL or from Hugging Face, from the model's name, purpose, or tags. Auto, fallback, and the default model never pick one. A chat that asks for one by id fails with an explanation.

A catalog model's `languages` say how well it writes each language it has a level for (multilingual spec §13–14, §31), best first: `language` (a BCP 47 tag), `level` (`limited`, `fair`, `good`, or `excellent`), `confidence` (`low`, `medium`, or `high`), and `sources` (`model_card`, `maintainer`, `benchmark`, `provider`, `community`, or `local_evaluation`). Levels are coarse on purpose. A language a model has no level for is unknown and left out. The levels in the catalog come from what each model card says it supports, judged by size for languages it lists but doesn't lead with; models installed by URL or from Hugging Face have none yet.

If the model fails before it shows or changes anything, the turn runs once more: on the same model on another computer when one has it, else on another installed quantization of the same model (smaller when it ran out of memory, otherwise the largest that fits), else on another installed model. After running out of memory, a larger version of the same model is never the fallback. Quantizations are matched by the model's Hugging Face repository. `chat.model_routed` then has `fallback: true`. The answer's steps say what happened, and `meta.notice` warns when the model that answered is noticeably smaller. A model whose `llama-server` exits while loading fails at once instead of after the 120-second readiness timeout.

### Effort, plans, checks, and Stop

`POST /chat` takes `effort`: `auto` (the default), `fast`, `balanced`, or `thorough`. Effort sets a budget, not a number of calls the client sees:

- **Fast** answers in one go. It doesn't plan, a look-up uses search results without reading pages, figures are checked but not sent back for correction, and a turn may make 3 tool calls.
- **Balanced** plans requests with several parts, reads one page per look-up, corrects figures once, and allows 10 tool calls.
- **Thorough** reads two pages per look-up, corrects figures twice, allows 16 tool calls, and lets Auto pick the largest model that fits.
- **Auto** uses Fast for a quick question, Thorough for a request that needs a detailed answer, has several parts, or uses the user's files or knowledge, and Balanced otherwise.

The `chat.effort` event reports the effort used. A chosen effort is listed in the answer's `steps`.

A request with several parts is worked through in parts. "Compare A, B and C…" and "research A vs B" become one part per subject, looked up on the web side by side when web search is allowed without asking. "Do X, then Y, then Z" becomes parts in order, each seeing the notes before it. The final answer is written from the parts' notes, or a requested file is made from them. `plan.created` carries `steps` and `parallel`, and `plan.step` carries `index`, `step`, and `status` (`running`, `done`, or `failed`).

Before an answer is shown, its arithmetic is recomputed. When the turn used reference material or tool results, each figure must appear in, or follow from, the lines about the same subject. Dates and years are skipped. This check needs no model. Only an answer with issues is sent back to the model once, with the issues named (`chat.verifying`), and the revision is kept if it fixes some. `verify.done` reports `issues`, `fixed`, and `remaining`. Remaining figures become the answer's `meta.notice`. An answer that describes tool calls instead of answering is asked for again without tools.

Two more checks follow:
- **Code:** fenced code blocks tagged `go`, `json`, `python`, or `bash`/`sh` are parsed, never run. Go and JSON are parsed in Toskar; Python with Python's own parser (`ast.parse`) and shell with `bash -n`, when installed. Untagged blocks, other languages, and sketches with `...` are skipped. Code that doesn't parse goes back to the model with the errors named, once per correction the effort allows, and the revision is kept when it has fewer errors. `verify.code` reports `blocks`, `issues`, `fixed`, and `remaining`, and errors left become the answer's `meta.notice`.
- **Links:** web addresses in the answer, outside code, are checked against the reference material, tool results, and the conversation; no request is made. A link no source gave is one the model wrote from memory and often doesn't open, so it goes back to the model with the links named, once per correction the effort allows, and the revision is kept when it has fewer. A site's home page, example addresses, and addresses on this computer or network are not flagged. `verify.links` reports `links`, `issues`, `fixed`, and `remaining`, and links left become the answer's `meta.notice`.
- **Contradictions:** at Thorough effort, an answer of 400 characters or more is checked by the reviewer for statements that contradict each other or the reference material. When some are found, the answer is rewritten once with them named, and kept when the contradictions drop. `verify.consistency` reports `found`, `fixed`, and `remaining`. A check whose reply can't be read counts as finding none, so it never holds an answer back.

Stopping a turn, with `POST /chat/stop` or by closing the stream, stops every model call, tool call, plan step, pending approval, and paired computer working on it. The part already written is saved as the answer, with `meta.notice` "Stopped before the answer was finished." A turn stopped in the middle of a plan keeps the notes of the parts that finished. A turn stopped before anything was written keeps a short note with the sources found so far. The `chat.stopped` event carries `conversation_id` and `kept`. A new message in the same chat stops a turn still running there.

### Context, memory, and look-ups

Window budgets are counted in tokens with the answering model's tokenizer (llama-server's `/tokenize`) while that model runs on this computer, and estimated otherwise: about a token per Chinese, Japanese, or Korean character, half a token per punctuation mark or symbol, and four characters a token for other text. A paired computer returns its llama-server's prompt count, and an external server its `usage.prompt_tokens` (requested with `stream_options.include_usage`, and dropped for servers that reject it), so the total is exact there too and only the breakdown is estimated. `context.estimated` is `true` only when the total itself is an estimate. `context.instructions` covers the whole system prompt except the tool list, including personalization, memories, and the user guide. `context.prompt_tokens` is the whole prompt, including tokens llama-server reused from its cache, and tokens no section accounts for, such as the chat template, count as `instructions`. When a conversation's history passes half of the model's window, a summary of the older messages is written after the reply and replaces them in later turns. The messages stay saved. The `chat.summarized` event follows. The `chat.complete` payload's `context.summarized_messages` counts the messages the summary covers, and `pipeline_ms` is the time from the request to the first model call. `context.limit` is the window the answering model's llama-server reports (`/props` `n_ctx`) when it runs on this computer, and the catalog's window otherwise. `context.memory_bytes`, when the model ran on this computer, is about how much memory that window reserves: its KV cache, from the model file's layer and attention-head counts at f16, an upper estimate for models with sliding-window attention.

Memory is on unless the setting `memory_enabled` is `false` or a conversation has `memory_off: true` (set with `PATCH /conversations/{id}`). A message that starts "Remember that…", "Forget…", or asks "What do you remember?" is answered without a model; the reply is saved as usual and the events `memory.saved` or `memory.deleted` follow. Other turns add the memories that fit the question to the instructions and list them as `memory` sources. A secret such as a password, key, or card number is not saved. A memory fits a question when it is about the person (identity and preferences), when it shares words with the question, or, with an embedding model installed, when it is close in meaning, whatever language either is written in (multilingual spec §18): a memory saved as "Mi proyecto usa Go" comes with "What language does my project use?". Each memory's `language` is the language it is written in, detected on this computer; its vector is made by the embedding model when first needed and again after an edit or a change of model.

When a question needs current information and the profile allows `internet.search` without asking, Toskar searches the web and reads the best page before the model answers. The `chat.lookup` event carries the `query`. The results reach the model as data, and the model answers without web tools for that turn.

### Tools

Each turn is offered only the tools it needs (spec §16). Huginn picks tool groups from the kind of request and cues in the message: web search for questions, files for a file name or folder, shell for "run" or "install", Git for "commit" or "branch". It then limits them to what the profile allows. A call to a tool that was not offered is refused, and the model is told which tools it has, so it cannot widen its own tools. The profile's Allow, Ask, and Deny still decide what runs. Tool ids have capability aliases, and `web.search`, `web.open`, `files.read`, `files.write`, `files.search`, and `shell.run` reach the built-in tools. A short answer that only writes out a call, such as `files.search {"query": "x"}`, is taken as the call when the tool was offered. Each call has a time limit (web 45 s, files 30 s, Git 90 s, shell 2 min), and `tool.failed` carries a `kind`: `timeout`, `cancelled`, `denied`, `not_offered`, `invalid`, or `failed`.

See [Tools](tools.md) for policies and the tool loop.

## Knowledge

A profile's `knowledge_sources` lists Mimir source ids. Chat searches them on every turn and adds the matching passages to the user turn as labelled reference material, never to the system prompt, and the model is told not to follow instructions inside them (§58). A specialized AI's knowledge sources are searched when it answers, and an API request can add sources with `yggdrasil.knowledge_sources`.

A knowledge source can read current data from a database or a web API instead of a file. `POST /knowledge/sources` takes `kind` `database` with `remote` `{"driver": "sqlite", "database": "~/shop.db", "query": "SELECT …"}`, or `driver` `postgres` or `mysql` with `connection_string`. It takes `kind` `api` with `remote` `{"url": "https://…", "items": "data.products", "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer …"}}`. `refresh_minutes` (1 to 10080, default 60) sets how old the data may get.

- **Queries:** a query must be one `SELECT`, `WITH`, or `VALUES` statement. It runs in a read-only transaction, and a SQLite file is opened read-only, so Toskar never changes the database. Each row becomes a passage labelled with its column names, and a query that returns more than 200,000 rows is refused.
- **APIs:** a JSON response that is a list of objects, or holds exactly one such list (or the list at `items`), becomes one passage per object. Other JSON, CSV, HTML, and text are read like files. Requests time out after 30 seconds, and responses are limited to 20 MB.
- **Credentials:** connection strings and header values are kept in the secrets directory, not the database. They are never returned: a source reports `remote` with the driver, query, URL, `items`, `header_names`, and `refresh_minutes`. `PATCH /knowledge/sources/{id}` with `remote` changes the settings. A blank `connection_string` or header value keeps the stored one, and the credentials are deleted with the source.
- **Refreshing:** when a search uses a source whose data is older than `refresh_minutes`, Mimir fetches it again in the background, and that search uses the data already indexed. `POST /knowledge/sources/{id}/refresh` fetches at once. If a fetch fails, the source is `failed` with the reason (credentials removed), and search keeps using the last data that was fetched.

Knowledge sources read scanned PDFs with text recognition (OCR). Pages with a text layer are read as before, and only the pages without one are recognized, so a scanned appendix in a digital document is read too. Recognition runs RapidOCR in a private Python environment that is installed under `runtimes/python/envs/ocr` the first time a scanned page needs it. The install is about 110 MB to download and 290 MB on disk, and the recognition models come with it, so nothing else is downloaded. A page takes about a second on an M5 Pro. Recognized text is remembered by file content, so a folder source does not recognize its scanned PDFs again when another file changes. On the Train page, a scanned PDF has no examples to train on, so it is recommended as knowledge. Recognition reads Chinese and English text with the models RapidOCR ships; accented letters of other languages may be misread, and other scripts are not recognized.

Knowledge search matches words (BM25). When an embedding model is installed (one with `support_role` `embedding`, such as `nomic-embed-text-v1.5-q8` in the catalog), it also matches meaning, so "What warranty do you offer?" finds a passage about a five-year guarantee. The embedding model runs in its own `llama-server` started with `--embedding`, loaded when first needed and unloaded by the idle sweeper like any model; it appears in `GET /models/running` with `mode` `embedding`. Passages are embedded in the background after a source is added or reindexed, and the vectors are kept in the daemon database. A reindex keeps the vectors of passages whose text did not change, and installing a different embedding model embeds every passage again. A source with more than 20,000 passages is searched by words only. Search never waits for embedding: it uses the vectors that exist. With more than one embedding model installed, the one rated in the most languages is used, so `bge-m3-q8` (BGE-M3, multilingual) is preferred to `nomic-embed-text-v1.5-q8` (English); switching embeds every passage again.

A source's `language` is the language most of its passages are written in, and `languages` lists every language found with how many passages are in it (multilingual spec §19). Both are detected on this computer when the source is indexed. With a multilingual embedding model, a question finds passages by meaning in any language, such as a Spanish question finding an English policy, and the answer is written in the answer language, not the document's.

Word and meaning matches are combined with reciprocal rank fusion. A passage found only by meaning must be similar enough to the question, and close to the best match. When words found something, it must also be at least as similar to the question as the best word match, so a question that names one product does not bring in every similar row. When a reranker model is installed (`support_role` `reranker`), it reorders the top 16 passages. Each hit from `POST /knowledge/search` has `match`: `keyword`, `semantic`, or `both`. `score` orders hits within one search only: BM25 for word-only search, the fused rank when meaning is used, and the reranker's score for passages it ordered. A knowledge source reports `embedded_count` and `embedding_model`. With no embedding model installed, if it cannot start, or while training is using the computer, search uses words only.

## Training and export

See [Train Your Own AI](features/train-your-own-ai.md) for the workflow.

A trained revision can be exported as one GGUF file that llama.cpp, LM Studio, Ollama, and other GGUF tools load without the adapter. `POST /training/ais/{id}/revisions/{n}/export` starts the merge and returns `202` with the status, or `200` when the file already exists. The merge runs `llama-export-lora` from the installed llama.cpp in the background, and it takes seconds for a small model and a minute or two for a large one. Tensors the adapter changed are written as F16, and the rest keep the base model's quantization, so the file is a little larger than the base model. The status has `state` (`none`, `exporting`, `ready`, or `failed`), `filename` (such as `tire-bot-r2.gguf`), `size_bytes` (the estimate while exporting), `error`, and the AI's `instructions`, which are not part of the file and are needed as the system prompt elsewhere. Exporting is refused when there is not enough free disk space, when the revision's adapter or base model is not on this computer, and in builds that ship only `llama-server`. `training.export.completed` and `training.export.failed` carry `ai_id`, `name`, and `revision`, and post a notification. Exports are deleted with their AI.

## Automations and notifications

An automation's `notification.mode` is `condition`, `change`, `always`, `failure` (only failed runs), or `none`. An automation runs on the same stack as chat: `model_id` `auto` picks a model for each run, and memories and connected knowledge are used the same way. Its `response_language` is the language results are written in: `account` (the default) follows the assistant language setting, `app` the App language, `auto` the language of the request, or a language tag such as `de`. A language the request asks for, such as "answer in English", always wins. Tools follow the unattended policy, because nobody is there to approve them. Tools listed in the automation's `tools` were approved when it was saved, and they run even if they change things. With no `tools`, only read-only tools the profile allows without asking can run. A tool the profile denies never runs. When a run reaches a tool that was not approved, the tool is skipped and the run continues. The run's `automation.completed` event lists the tool in `skipped`, and an `approval` notification says which tools to approve.

**Schedules.** `schedule.kind` is one of:
- `once`: at `at`.
- `daily`, `weekly`, or `monthly`, at each of `times` (`[{"hour": 8, "minute": 0}, {"hour": 17, "minute": 30}]`, up to 24 a day) in `time_zone`.
  - `weekly` runs on `weekdays`, where Sunday is 0, so `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is weekdays only.
  - `monthly` runs on `month_day`, or on a month's last day when the month is shorter.
- `interval`: every `every_seconds`.
- `manual`: never on its own, only from Run now or a webhook.
- `cron`: a five-field `cron` expression (minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week) read in `time_zone`.
  - It takes `*`, ranges, steps, lists, names such as `MON`, and `@daily`-style shorthands.
  - When both the day of month and the day of week are restricted, a day matching either runs.
  - An expression that never runs, such as `0 0 31 2 *`, is refused.

Saved schedules also carry `hour`, `minute`, and `weekday`: the first time and day, for clients that read one. A client that sends only those gets a one-time-a-day, one-day schedule, as before.

**Reading a request.** `POST /automations/parse` with `{"text": "Every morning at 8:00 AM, check this product and tell me if the price is below $500.", "time_zone": "America/Los_Angeles", "language": "en"}` returns an automation to review and save: `name` ("Price below $500"), `prompt` (the task without the schedule, "Check this product. Report the current price."), `schedule`, `notification`, and `notes` on what was assumed, such as a time of day when none was given.
- **Languages:** a request may be written in `language` or in English. `language` is also the language of the name and notes, and the currency of an amount written without one. Empty `language` uses the App language, and empty `time_zone` this computer's.
- **Words:** the words come from `i18n/requests/<language>.json`, which the web app reads too, so the form and the API read a request the same way.
- **A model as fallback:** when the words find no schedule, such as "first thing on weekdays", Auto's model reads the request into the same fields. A schedule it gives that couldn't run is refused. Its result carries a note saying the AI read it, so the person checks it before saving.
- **Errors:** a request with no schedule the words or the model can read answers `400` `REQUEST_NO_SCHEDULE`. `REQUEST_EMPTY`, `REQUEST_BAD_TIME`, and `REQUEST_TIME_ZONE` cover the rest.

**From chat.** When a message asks for something on a repeating schedule, such as "every morning at 8, summarize the news" or "jeden Montag", or says "remind me" or "automate", chat is offered the `automations.schedule` tool. It reads the request like `POST /automations/parse`, in the language it's written in, and drafts the automation without scheduling it. The answer's `meta.automation` carries the draft: `id`, `name`, `prompt`, `schedule`, `notification`, the chat's `profile_id`, and `notes`. The apps show it as a card, and the person creates it with `POST /automations`, passing the draft's fields with `model_id` `auto`, `draft_id`, and `conversation_id`. Creating the same draft again returns the automation it made, and the automation keeps the conversation it came from. When a run of it notifies, its result, without the JSON its condition asked for, is added to that conversation as an answer the person can reply to. Its `meta.automation_run` has `automation_id`, `run_id`, and `name`. `automation.completed` carries the `conversation_id`, and the notification opens the chat. If the chat was deleted, the notification opens the automation instead. `POST /automations/{id}/runs/{run_id}/chat` opens any successful run's result in a chat to reply to. It returns the `conversation_id` of the chat the result was already posted to, or makes a chat named after the automation with the result as its first answer. A run's `conversation_id` names that chat. A failed or unfinished run answers `409` `AUTOMATION_NO_RESULT`.

**Triggers.** An automation's `trigger` runs it only when something changed: `{"kind": "page", "url": "https://…"}` for a web page's text, `{"kind": "feed", "url": "https://…"}` for new posts in an RSS or Atom feed, or `{"kind": "folder", "path": "~/Documents/Invoices"}` for files in a folder, or one file, in the home folder.
- **Checking:** the schedule says how often to check. A check fetches the page or feed (public addresses only, as the web tools do) and compares it with the last check, without a model.
- **Nothing new:** the next check is scheduled, with no run. `last_checked_at` says when that last happened.
- **A change:** the automation runs, and its prompt ends with what changed: lines added and removed on the page, or the new posts with their links.
- **Folders:** a check compares each file's size and modification time, so it opens nothing that didn't change. Hidden files are left out, and it goes 8 folders deep and up to 5,000 files. A run can't open files outside Toskar's workspace, so it's told which files were added, changed, and removed, with the start of each new or changed text file (4,000 bytes each, 20,000 in all).
- **First check:** it only remembers what it found.
- **After a run:** what a check found is kept only once its run succeeds, so a run that fails or retries sees the change again.
- **Can't fetch:** a check that can't fetch fails the run, so failure notices and auto-pause apply.
- **Changing or clearing:** watching a different link starts fresh. On update, `{"trigger": {"kind": ""}}` runs on the schedule again.
- **Webhooks:** `{"kind": "webhook"}` runs the automation when another service calls its link, usually with the `manual` schedule, which never runs on its own.
  - **The link:** `POST /api/v1/automations/{id}/hook` makes the link and returns `{token, path}`, shown only then (only the token's SHA-256 is kept). A new one stops the old one, and `hook_set` says one exists.
  - **Calling it:** `POST /hooks/{token}`, which needs no API key, answers `202` with `run_id`. The body, up to 64 KB of any type, ends the run's prompt as data from that service, not instructions.
  - **Refusals:** an unknown token answers `404`, a paused automation `409` `AUTOMATION_PAUSED`, a call within 10 seconds of the last `429` `HOOK_TOO_SOON` with `Retry-After`, and a bigger body `413` `HOOK_TOO_LARGE`.
- **Chaining:** `{"kind": "after", "automation_id": "…", "when": "succeeded"}` runs the automation right after another one finishes well. With `"when": "notified"`, it runs only when that one notified, such as after a price condition was met. Its prompt ends with the other one's result, labelled as data.
  - An after trigger on a missing automation, or one that comes back around to itself through others, is refused when saved.
  - A chain stops after 5 automations in a row.
  - A follower usually has the `manual` schedule.
  - `toskarctl`: `--trigger after --after <id> [--after-when notified]`.
- **Untrusted content:** what a trigger delivers was written by someone else. A run it starts can't use tools that change things outside Toskar, such as the terminal, file writes in the workspace, or Git pushes, even ones approved for the automation. They're skipped and reported like unapproved tools. Reading and creating files in Toskar's store still work.
- **`toskarctl`:** `--trigger page|feed|folder|webhook|none` with `--trigger-url <url>` or `--trigger-path <path>`; `--schedule manual`; and `toskarctl automations hook <id>` prints a new link.

**Saving results.** An automation's `save_folder`, such as `~/Documents/Toskar/News`, also saves each successful result to that folder as a new Markdown file. The file is named for when the run finished in the schedule's time zone and for the automation, such as `2026-10-07 08.30 News.md`. A second file in the same minute gets a number. The folder must be in the home folder (`~` is the home folder) and is made when needed. A path outside it is refused when the automation is saved. The run's `saved_file` is where its result went. A file that can't be written is logged and doesn't fail the run. `toskarctl automations create|update --save-folder` sets the folder, and `--save-folder ""` stops saving.

**Digest.** With the `automation_digest` setting at a time such as `08:00` (in `automation_digest_zone`), one answer a day in an *Automation digest* chat sums up every automation that finished since the last digest:
- each automation's latest result, without its JSON, and how many times it failed, with the last error;
- one notification that opens the chat (`notifications:notices.automationDigest`).

It's put together from the results, without a model. A day when nothing ran sends nothing. A computer that was off at the time sends it once when it's back. Turning the digest on doesn't send at once: the first one goes out at the next time.

**Notify on change.** `change` compares a run with the last successful one by what changed, not how the model worded it. In order:
1. **Values:** when both results carry the same structured values, such as a price or availability, nothing changed.
2. **Sources:** each run fingerprints what its read-only tools returned, such as the pages and search results it read. The same fingerprint means nothing changed, with no model call.
3. **Judgment:** otherwise the run's model, still loaded, judges whether anything the person would care about changed, beyond rewording. The notification says what changed, in the response language.
4. **Text:** if the model gives no usable answer, a different text counts as a change.

The first successful run is the baseline. The `available` condition asks for a JSON `available` flag, like `price` for a threshold, so it works in every language.

**Conditions and decisions.** A saved `prompt` is only the task. When a run starts, Toskar adds what its condition needs in the result: a JSON `price` in the threshold's currency, an `available` flag, or a `significant` flag. An instruction an older client stored in the prompt is removed when the automation is saved or runs, so it is never asked for twice. Each run records why it did or didn't notify: `notify_detail` is a key the apps show as `automations:notice.<notify_detail>`, such as `notBelow`, `inStock`, or `unchanged`, and `notify_values` fills its placeholders, such as `{"price": 640, "amount": 500, "currency": "USD"}`. `notBelow`, `notAbove`, `notAvailable`, and `notSignificant` mean the condition wasn't met. Runs from before this have neither.

**Runs.**
- **Running together:** due automations run two at a time, so a slow one doesn't hold up the rest. An automation that is still running isn't started again.
- **Time limit:** each run has 20 minutes. One that takes longer is stopped, fails with `AUTOMATION_TIMEOUT`, and isn't retried.
- **Run now:** `POST /automations/{id}/run` answers `202` with the run as soon as it has started (`status` `running`). The run goes on without the request, so closing the page doesn't stop it. Its progress and result arrive as `automation.started`, then `automation.completed` or `automation.failed`, and in the automation's `history`. Running one that is already running answers `409` `AUTOMATION_RUNNING`. `toskarctl automations run` waits for the result.
- **Retries:** a failed run is retried by its error code when it has one, such as `CONNECTION_LOST` or `COMPUTER_OFFLINE`, and never for `OUT_OF_MEMORY`, `NO_MODEL_INSTALLED`, or `AUTOMATION_TIMEOUT`. The error's text decides only for errors without a known code.
- **History:** `GET /automations/{id}` includes the newest 20 runs in `history`, and `history_more` when there are older ones. `GET /automations/{id}/runs?before=<run id>&limit=` pages them, newest first: `{runs, more}`, up to 100 runs a page.
- **Preview:** `POST /automations/preview` runs the draft in its `response_language`, with "today" in its schedule's time zone, as the saved automation will.
- **Pausing:** an automation that fails three times in a row, for any reason, is paused, and its notification says why in the App language. Running out of memory pauses it after two.

Notifications come from Gjallarhorn. Each one is stored first and then delivered to its channels. A notification has `category` (`automation`, `approval`, `model`, `training`, `health`, or `system`), `severity` (`info`, `success`, `warning`, or `error`), `title`, `body`, and a `link` back to its source in the app, such as `/automations?id=…`. Each channel's attempt is recorded in `deliveries`. A delivery is `delivered`, `failed`, or `suppressed`; for example, desktop notices are suppressed when `notify_task_finish` is off. A repeat with the same source within 10 minutes is counted on the first notification (`repeat_count`) and marks it unread again. The `notification.created` event carries `id`, `category`, `severity`, `title`, `body`, `message`, and `link`. Finished and failed automations post to the desktop too.

Health notifications (category `health`) come on changes only. A paired computer that goes offline gets a warning, unless `notify_peer_offline` is off, and one when it is back online. A computer that was never announced offline is not announced back. A model that crashes twice within 30 minutes gets an error saying it keeps crashing, at most once an hour, with a hint when it is likely running out of memory; a single crash is handled by answering on another model. These stay out of desktop notices and go to the bell and to destinations that take `health`.

**Destinations.** Notifications can also go to email, through your own SMTP server, to phones and computers through ntfy, and to webhooks. Each destination has `categories` (empty: all) and `min_severity` (`info`, `success`, `warning`, or `error`), and receives every notification that matches, from any part of Toskar.
- **Email:** `host`, `port` (587, or 465 with `tls`), `username`, `from`, `to` (up to 20 addresses), and `tls`: `starttls` (the default), `tls`, or `none`. `none` is allowed only for a server on this computer, so a password is never sent unencrypted over the network. The password is stored in `secrets/notify-<id>`, never returned, and kept when a change leaves it blank.
- **Webhooks:** must use `https`, except for an address on this computer or the local network (`localhost`, private IP addresses, `.local`, `.lan`, `.home.arpa`). Redirects are not followed. Each request is a JSON `POST`: `version` (1), `notification_id`, `created_at`, `category`, `severity`, `title`, `body`, `language` (the BCP 47 tag `title` and `body` are written in, the App language), `message` (when there is one), `link`, `repeat_count` (when more than 1), and `source` (`type`, `id`). The `Toskar-Signature` header is `t=<unix seconds>,v1=<hex HMAC-SHA256 of "<t>.<body>">`, keyed with the destination's secret. `Toskar-Notification-Id` repeats the id, so a receiver can ignore a delivery it already handled. Both are also sent under their names from before the rename, `Yggdrasil-Signature` and `Yggdrasil-Notification-Id`, with the same values.

- **Push (ntfy):** `server` (default `https://ntfy.sh`, or your own; https except on the local network), `topic` (letters, digits, `-`, `_`, up to 64), `content`, and `open_url`. `content` is `full` (title and text) or `private` (only "You have a new Toskar notification"); private is the default on ntfy.sh, where anyone who knows a topic can read it. Severity sets ntfy's priority: errors 4 (high), warnings 3, everything else 2. With `open_url` (this Toskar's address), tapping the notification opens its link there. An access token for a protected topic is sent as `password`, stored in `secrets/notify-<id>`, and sent as a bearer token. ntfy has apps for Android and iPhone and works in a browser; no Yeix-hosted service is involved.

**Language.** A notification's `message` is its title and body as catalog keys with the values they need (`{"title": {"key": "notifications:notices.modelReady"}, "body": [{"key": "notifications:notices.modelReadyBody", "params": {"model": "Qwen 2.5 7B"}}]}`, from `i18n/locales/<language>/notifications.json`), so each app shows it in its own App language; a piece with `text` instead of `key`, such as an automation's name or what a model wrote, is shown as it is. `title` and `body` stay in English. Desktop notices, email, push, and webhooks are written in the App language (`ui_locale`) when they are sent; with the system language, they are in English.

**Delivery.** Email, push, and webhook deliveries go out in the background, so a slow server never holds up an automation. A delivery is `pending` until it is sent, then `delivered`, `failed`, or `cancelled` (its destination was removed). A failed delivery is retried after 1, 5, and 30 minutes, then given up, without running the work that made the notification again. Failures that retrying cannot fix are not retried, and their `error` says what to change: a refused sign-in or ntfy access token, an unknown recipient, an untrusted certificate, a server without STARTTLS, a webhook answering 4xx other than 408 or 429, or one that redirects. Every email, push, and webhook delivery is recorded in What left this computer as kind `notification`.

**Quiet hours.** Between `start` and `end` in `time_zone`, deliveries outside the app are `held` until quiet hours end. That covers desktop notices, email, push, and webhooks. With `allow` `errors` (the default), errors still go out; `nothing` holds everything. Held notifications are in the notification center at once.

**Digests.** A destination with `digest` (`{"at": "18:00", "time_zone": "America/Juneau"}`) gets one message a day instead of each notice: deliveries wait as `digest` until that time, then go out together, titled "N notifications" and listing each notice's title and the first line of its body (up to 30, then a count). Errors still go out at once. A digest due in quiet hours waits for them to end. A failed digest is retried like any delivery. Setting `digest` to `{"at": ""}` sends each notice again.

## Sharing the computer

Chat, automations, knowledge indexing, benchmarks, and training share this computer in that order of priority. A chat or API request, including a request from a paired computer, never waits. An automation run waits while a chat is running, and for 20 seconds after one, so it does not load a model between someone's messages. A benchmark also waits for automations, and it waits again before each model, because loading a model unloads the others. Background embedding of knowledge passages waits for chat and automations before each small batch, and does not start while training runs. Training waits for all of them before it unloads models to free memory. While work waits, `work.waiting` carries `class`, `label`, and `reason` ("Waiting for your chat to finish"), and the benchmark's progress or the training job's detail shows the reason. A chat that arrives during training is still answered: on a paired computer that has the model when there is one, and then its steps say `This computer is training, so <computer> answered`. Otherwise it is answered here, and its steps say `Training "…" is using this computer (about N minutes left)`. Placement avoids a training computer for any role unless the profile prefers this computer or pins the role, and paired computers say in their health answer when they are training, so work avoids them too. `GET /nodes` marks a training computer with `training: true`. If its model runs out of memory, the error says so, with the estimate and what to do. Out-of-memory failures are not retried. An automation that runs out of memory twice in a row is paused, and its notification explains why; one that fails three times in a row for any other reason is paused too.

## Connected services

Content from a connected service, such as an email or a calendar event, stays in the language it was written in unless you ask for a translation; Toskar's own text around it follows the App language (multilingual spec §21). Sign-ins and what a service may do never depend on language settings.

Connected services add tools. Today they are:
- GitHub (`github.search`, `github.issue`, `github.comment`).
- Home Assistant (`homeassistant.states`, `homeassistant.call`).
- Email over IMAP and SMTP (`email.search`, `email.read`, `email.draft`, `email.send`, `email.archive`).
- Calendar over CalDAV (`calendar.search`, `calendar.availability`, `calendar.create`, `calendar.update`, `calendar.cancel`).

Email and Calendar sign in with an app password. See [Tools](tools.md#email-and-calendar).
- **Connecting:** `PUT /connectors/{id}` checks the values with the service before storing anything, and returns the account it connected as. A blank secret field keeps the stored value.
- **Storage:** credentials are stored in the `secrets` directory of the data directory, not in the database. They are added to a request only when a tool runs, so they are never part of model context, events, or tool arguments.
- **Responses:** the API never returns a secret value; `values` shows a stored token as its last four characters only. Results and errors are scrubbed of any credential value before the model sees them.
- **Policies:** connected tools join the tool catalog with `source` `connector:<id>`. Reading is allowed and changes ask first, unless a profile sets its own policy for the tool.
- **Selection:** they are offered when a message is about the service. That means it names the service, or uses words like issues or pull requests for GitHub and lights or sensors for Home Assistant. It also counts when the message uses words the service taught: Home Assistant's device names, learned when it connects and whenever all devices are read. Tools that change something are offered only when the message asks for a change ("turn on", "comment").
- **Fetched first:** a read tool marked `prefetch` (Home Assistant's device list) is called before the model answers a message about its service, when the profile allows it without asking. Its data, written as plain lines, replaces the web look-up for that turn.
- **Untrusted data:** what they return is treated as untrusted data (§58), and links in results become sources.

## MCP

MCP tool sources add tools the same way, with `source` `mcp:<source>`; secrets are kept in `secrets/mcp-<source>.json`. `/mcp` (outside `/api/v1`) is Toskar's own MCP server for other apps, checked like `/v1`, and `/mcp/oauth/callback` is where a tool source's sign-in returns. See [MCP](mcp.md).

## Personalization

Personalization shapes how answers look in every chat, automation, and API request. It has four choices: `length` (`brief`, `balanced`, `detailed`), `tone` (`friendly`, `neutral`, `direct`), `format` (`prose`, `lists`), and `units` (`metric`, `imperial`). It also has two short notes, `about_me` and `instructions`, of up to 1,500 characters each. It is stored as a setting and added to the model's instructions as style guidance, after a specialized AI's own instructions. It is kept apart from permissions: what a tool may do comes only from profiles and Settings. A personalization note or a memory that tries to grant a permission is refused with 400, for example "you can always push without asking" or "don't ask before running commands". The refusal says where permissions are set. A memory that states a preference, such as "I use the terminal a lot", is saved and changes no policy.

**Answer language.** Every chat, automation, and API request is answered in one language, decided on this computer (multilingual spec §11–12): a language the message asks for, such as "answer in English" or "antworte auf Deutsch", always wins. Then the `assistant_language_mode` setting decides: `auto` (the default) answers in the language the message is written in, or the conversation's recent language when the message is too short to tell; `language` answers in `assistant_language`; `app` answers in the App language (`ui_locale`). After that come this computer's language and English. Code, commands, file names, and quoted text keep their language.

## Privacy and run records

Each run records what left this computer.
- **Record kinds:** `web_search` (the query), `web_page` (the address), `places` (the map service and the place, kind of place and point, or route asked for), `paired_computer` (the prompt and context, or training examples), `external_server` (a chat sent to a server that is not on this computer), `connector` (the service and what it was asked; long text such as a comment's body is left out), `notification` (an email or webhook delivery: the server or host, and the notification's title), `community_ratings` (a rating shared or withdrawn, with the model, hardware class, and how it runs when that is shared, or the public ratings summary downloaded), and `update_check` (the daily look at toskar.ai for a newer version; nothing is sent but the request).
- **Record fields:** `source` (`chat`, `api`, `automation`, `training`), plus `conversation_id` and `task_id` when there are any.

Memories and knowledge sources have `local_only`. Set it with `PATCH /memory/{id}` or the knowledge update, `{"local_only": true}`. A turn that uses a local-only memory or a passage from a local-only source runs on this computer, even when placement would have chosen a paired computer, and its steps say so.

Run records hold prompts and tool results: tasks and their steps, automation run results, and the egress record.
- **Retention:** they are kept for `retention_days` (30 by default; 0 keeps them) and removed daily.
- **Delete now:** `POST /privacy/delete-runs` removes them now and returns how many.
- **Exceptions:** each automation keeps its latest successful result, which the `change` notification mode compares against, and work that may still be running is never removed.
- **Chats:** chats are not run records; the `save_chat_history` setting covers them.

Every chat turn, API request, and automation run is traced. A chat or API run's id is the turn's task id, and the answer's `meta.run_id` names it. A run has:
- `strategy`: how it was handled, such as "Looked up the web first" or "Worked through 3 parts side by side". It also includes the routing reason and a fallback, when there was one.
- `effort`.
- `models`: per model, role, and computer. Each entry has the calls, `load_ms` (a real model start of 150 ms or more), `first_token_ms`, `ttft_ms`, tokens in and out, `cached_tokens` (from llama.cpp's cache), and tokens per second.
- `tools`: calls, failures, and total time.
- `nodes`, `workers` and `parallel` for a plan, verification passes with issues and fixes, and `retries`.
- `context_tokens` of `context_limit`, `latency_ms`, and `pipeline_ms`.
- `status`: `completed`, `failed`, or `stopped`.

In advanced mode, an answer has "Run details". Runs are run records, so the retention and delete action above apply to them.


### Updates

`GET /updates` says whether a newer Toskar is out. Release builds installed from a download read https://toskar.ai/releases/latest.json a minute after starting and then once a day, while the `update_check` setting is on (the default). The answer has `supported` (this build checks), `enabled` (and the setting is on), `current`, `available`, `checked_at`, and `latest` (`version`, `published_at`, `prerelease`, `notes_url`, `download_url`). `available` is true when `latest` is newer than `current`; a prerelease is offered only to a prerelease build. The App Store edition, the copy the desktop app runs (`TOSKAR_UPDATE_CHECK=off`), and development builds don't check and say `supported: false`. Each check is listed in What left this computer as `update_check`.

## Community ratings

A person rates a model with 1 to 5 stars and optional reasons (`great_responses`, `fast`, `slow`, `stable`, `crashed`, `too_much_memory`, `great_for_coding`, `great_for_chat`, `good_tool_use`, `poor_tool_use`). The rating is kept on this computer.
- **Sharing:** `PUT /models/{id}/rating` with `{"stars": 4, "tags": ["fast"], "share": true}` also sends it to the ratings service ([yeixio/toskar-ratings](https://github.com/yeixio/toskar-ratings)). `GET` returns `shares`, exactly what that sends besides the stars and tags: the model (a slug of its Hugging Face repository, quantization, format, runtime, and backend) and the hardware class (platform, architecture, accelerator maker and model, memory type, and a memory band). A random rating ID, made the first time a rating is shared and never derived from the computer, and the app version go with it. `share: false` withdraws a shared rating; `DELETE` withdraws it and removes it here. A `502` means the rating is saved here but the service could not be reached.
- **In recommendations:** with community ratings on, they are one signal next to the curated order, for the Best overall, Best coding, and Best reasoning picks in `/models/fit` (this computer only) and the main model in `/models/recommend`. A model's signal is its cohort's weighted score less the summary's `prior`, from hardware like this computer's when that cohort is published and from everyone otherwise; early ratings count half. The pick is the eligible model whose signal, less 0.3 for each place down the curated list, is highest, so a model two places down needs to be rated 0.6 better to be chosen first, and a poorly rated first choice gives way. Ratings never make a model that cannot run here eligible. `community_chosen` on a winner or recommendation says ratings changed the pick. Only the summary already kept is used, so recommendations never download anything.
- **How it runs:** `"observations": true` with `share` also sends how the model ran on this computer in the last 30 days, as `GET` shows it in `observations`: the median tokens per second and time to first token (from 3 or more replies), starts and failed starts, whether it crashed or ran out of memory, and the band of the most context a reply used. Replies that ran on a paired computer are left out. Starts, failed starts, and crashes are counted from when this version is installed and kept 90 days. What is sent is a snapshot from when the rating is saved; saving again updates it. In `/ratings/community`, a cohort where people shared this has `observed`, `median_tokens_per_second`, `median_ttft_ms`, `successful_start_rate`, `crash_rate`, and `out_of_memory_rate`.
- **Comparable models:** a model installed from somewhere other than Hugging Face, or whose quantization is not in its name, has `rateable: false` and a `reason`. It can still be rated here.
- **Language:** `"language": "es"` says the language the model was used in (multilingual spec §23). It is reduced to what ratings collect by, a base tag such as `pt` for `pt-BR`, with Chinese kept as `zh-Hans` or `zh-Hant`; anything that is not a language tag is a `400`. `GET` returns it as `language`, and a shared rating sends it. Leaving it out says none. In `/ratings/community`, a model's `languages` are its ratings by language, each with `language`, `ratings`, `average`, `weighted_score`, and `confidence`, for everyone who runs it the same way: published with at least 3 ratings, never split by hardware. With community ratings on, Auto counts them when choosing a model for an answer in that language: a language with 10 or more ratings sets the model's level for it (Excellent from a weighted score of 4.3, Good from 3.7, Fair from 3.0, Limited below), and one with 3 to 9 moves the level one step at most. A level the ratings moved lists `community` among its `sources`.
- **When to ask:** `ask` is `true` for an installed, unrated model that has answered 10 times on at least 2 days, while the `ratings_prompts` setting is on (the default) and the person has not dismissed it.
- **Community scores:** with the `community_ratings` setting on (off by default), `GET /ratings/community` downloads the public summary at most once a day, from the service or, when it cannot be reached, from [yeixio/toskar-model-data](https://github.com/yeixio/toskar-model-data), and keeps it for offline use. For each local model it returns `similar`, the narrowest published group of hardware like this computer's (`family`, then `class`, then `backend`), and `overall`. Each has `ratings`, `average`, `weighted_score` (leaning toward the average while there are few ratings), and `confidence` (`limited`, `early`, or `community`). Ratings of different quantizations, runtimes, or backends are never combined.

## Profiles and orchestration

A profile's `orchestration` object holds its advanced controls. Every field is optional; empty keeps the default, which follows the chat's effort.

| Field | Values | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `strategy` | `single`, `planned`, `team` | How a request is worked through. Empty is Auto. `single`: one model, no plan. `planned`: a request with several parts is always worked through in parts. `team`: a planner splits the request, workers do the parts, and a reviewer checks the answer; quick questions are still answered directly |
| `effort` | `fast`, `balanced`, `thorough` | The profile's effort when a chat leaves effort on Auto |
| `planning` | `on`, `off`, `always` | `on` works through requests with several parts in parts, whatever the effort; `always` also asks the planner model to split a request with no obvious parts |
| `max_workers` | 2–8 | Most parts in a plan |
| `parallel` | `on`, `off` | `off` works through parts one at a time |
| `verification` | `off`, `check`, `correct`, `thorough` | `off` skips the figure check; `check` reports only; `correct` and `thorough` allow one or two correction passes |
| `max_tool_calls` | 1–50 | Most tool calls in one turn |
| `memory` | `off` | Keeps persistent memory out of the profile's chats |
| `context_share` | 0.1–0.9 | Most of the model's window earlier messages may use |
| `fallback` | `off` | Shows a failure instead of answering on another model |
| `deliberate` | `never`, `always`, `auto` | Whether answers are drafted independently and compared (#459, [deliberate.md](deliberate.md)). Empty is `never`; `auto` behaves like `never` until the quality run shows where it helps. With `always`, the turn's answer and two more drafts (roles `drafter:2` and `drafter:3`, at temperatures 0.6 and 0.9, on other computers when there are any, without tools) are compared by their short final answers: when most agree, that draft is kept. When they disagree, or the answers are too long to compare, each draft is checked by the next drafter (structured `{claims, disagreements, likely_errors}`, at most 700 tokens), and a judge writes the answer from the drafts and the checks, saying where they still disagree (the profile's `judge` model, else its `reviewer`, else the answering model; at most 2,048 tokens). If that fails, the turn's own answer stands. The answer's meta gains `deliberation` (`outcome`: `agreed`, `majority`, `disagreed`, or `long`; `final`; `drafts` with `role`, `model_id`, `node_id`, `node_name`, `final`, `text`, `chosen`, `failed`; `critiques` with `draft`, `critic`, `claims`, `disagreements`, `likely_errors`, `failed`; and `judge` with `role`, `model_id`, `node_id`, `node_name` when it wrote the answer), its steps say how it went, and `deliberate.draft`, `deliberate.critique`, and `deliberate.done` events report it as it runs. Small talk, answers that must be JSON, answers about pictures, and Team profiles aren't deliberated |
| `fallback_models` | up to 8 model ids | Tried in order when the answering model fails, before Toskar picks another installed model |
| `retries` | 1–3 | Tries after a model fails before showing anything (default 1). Each try first runs the same model on another online computer that has it, then another model |
| `timeout_seconds` | 10–3600 | Stops a turn that runs longer; the answer so far is kept and says it reached the time limit |

Invalid values are refused with 400. In advanced mode, the profile editor has an Orchestration section, alongside model roles, tools, knowledge, and placement.

A profile's `roles` assign models, and optionally computers, to these roles. A role without a model uses the model the chat chose, or Auto's pick.

| Role | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| `assistant` | Writing the answer (the primary model) |
| `fast` | Quick questions, when the chat is on Auto |
| `coding` | Coding requests, when the chat is on Auto |
| `planner` | Splitting a request into parts |
| `worker` | Each part of a plan. With the Team strategy or a worker model, each part gets its own slot (`worker:1`, `worker:2`, …) that Norn can place on another computer, and parts on different computers are written at the same time |
| `reviewer` | Checking the answer |

A profile's `node_policy` holds its placement rules:

| Field | Values | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mode` | `automatic`, `prefer_local`, `manual` | Where roles run by default; `manual` relies on role pins |
| `preferred_nodes` | computer ids | Favored when they have the model |
| `denied_nodes` | computer ids | Never used |
| `remote` | `off` | Every turn stays on this computer |

A computer cannot be both preferred and denied. A role pinned to a computer still follows its pin; a worker slot such as `worker:2` follows the `worker` role's pin.

`orchestrator_id` is `simple` for every profile. A profile sent with the older `team` orchestrator, or with the role names `coordinator` and `researcher`, is stored with the Team strategy and the roles `planner` and `assistant`. Profiles saved by older versions are migrated the same way at startup.

## Structured results

Structured results are checked the same way elsewhere:
- **Tool arguments:** they are checked against each tool's schema before the tool runs. Safe repairs are made, such as `"7"` for a whole number, or JSON data where text is expected. A call with an argument of the wrong type is refused with `kind` `invalid`, naming the argument, so the model can call again.
- **Automations:** a condition automation's result must end with the JSON its condition reads: `{"price": number}` for a threshold, or `{"significant": boolean}`. A threshold's optional `currency` (ISO 4217, such as `EUR`; omitted means `USD`) is the currency the run reports the price in, so the numbers compare as they are. That JSON is read with the same repairs. When it is missing or wrong, the model is asked once to supply it from its own answer. Notices show the prose, never the JSON.

## Capability inventory

The capability inventory lists what exists right now:
- `models` (with the computers they are on and whether they are running), `nodes` (online, memory, whether they can train), and `tools` from every source (built in, connected services, MCP), enabled or not;
- `connectors`, `providers` (runtimes and MCP tool sources, with health), and stored `artifacts`;
- `abilities`, each with `available`, the tools or models it comes `via`, and a `note` saying how it works or what would make it possible. Abilities are worked out from tools and models by what they do, so a new MCP tool that sends email counts as email without code.

A chat question about what Toskar can do, such as "Can you generate an image?", "Do you have access to my email?", or "Which computer can run Qwen 2.5 14B?", gets the matching facts as trusted instructions. The model answers from them instead of guessing, and the answer's steps say so. In the app, Diagnostics shows the same list.

Three behaviors come from the quality test set (`tests/quality`):
- **Plain questions:** a plain question is answered without tools; the message must ask for a search, a file, a command, and so on.
- **Capability questions:** a short question about what Toskar can do is answered straight from the capability inventory, without a model.
- **False claims:** an answer that says it changed something, when no tool that changes things ran, gets the notice "Nothing was changed: no tool ran to do this, whatever the answer says."

**Questions about Toskar.** The user guide (`docs/user-guide/guide.json`) ships inside the daemon. A question about Toskar itself, one that names it or its screens, or one that matches the guide's own words strongly, gets up to four matching guide passages (about 3,000 characters) in the turn's instructions, and the model is told to answer from them, name screens as they do, and say when they don't cover the question. The answer's steps say which sections it read. Questions about anything else get nothing added. A short how-to question about MCP is answered directly, without a model.

## Caches

Every cache declares its policy: `key`, `ttl`, `invalidation`, `scope`, and `privacy` (`public` or `personal`). Secret data, such as credentials, is never cached; a cache that would hold it is refused when it is created.

| Cache | Key | Kept | Cleared when | Privacy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `web_search` | the query, in lower case | 15 min | age; run records deleted | personal |
| `web_pages` | the page address | 30 min | age; run records deleted | personal |
| `capabilities` | one inventory snapshot | 30 s | a model downloads, loads, or unloads; a computer pairs or goes on- or offline; a tool is turned on or off | public |
| `model_search` | Hugging Face search text and limit | 5 min | age | public |
| `knowledge_index` | source and passage (on disk) | until invalidated | files change; reindex; source removed | personal |

A repeat web search or page read is answered from the cache. The tool does not run, nothing leaves this computer (so no egress record is written), and the run trace counts it in `cache_hits`. In-memory caches are bounded, dropping the least recently used entry first, and can be cleared one at a time. "Delete run records now" also clears every personal in-memory cache.

## Client contract

The desktop app, mobile apps, and other clients read a versioned contract: events, run traces, answers with their citations, steps, and files, artifacts, notifications, and egress records. The version is `major.minor`, now `1.25` (1.1 added `repeat_count` to notifications; 1.2 added `setup` to answers, an offer to install what a request needed; 1.3 added stable error codes to chat streams; 1.4 added `message` to notifications, their title and body as catalog keys; 1.5 added `error_code` and `error_details` to run traces; 1.6 added `context` to answers, the context gauge; 1.7 added `backend` and `device` to the models in a run; 1.8 added them to answers; 1.9 added `artifact_id` to file citations, the chat file a source names, so a client can offer it for download; 1.10 added `automation` to answers, an automation a chat drafted for the person to confirm; 1.11 added `automation_run`, marking a result an automation posted to its chat; 1.12 added `slow` and `tight_memory` to setup offers; 1.13 added `expires_at` to artifacts, when a file that belongs to no chat is removed; 1.14 added `remote` and `free_bytes` to setup offers, a paired computer to set it up on; 1.15 added `encryption` to computers, whether traffic to a paired one is encrypted; 1.16 added `topics` to profiles, the topic controls that keep an assistant on its subject; 1.17 added `topic` to run traces, what an Enforce profile's topic check found; 1.18 added `web_sites` and `web_keywords` to topic controls, the web limit; 1.19 added `parent_id` and `versions` to messages, for retrying and editing; 1.20 added `remote_access_enabled`, `remote_access_port`, and `remote_access_address` to settings, access from anywhere; 1.21 added `remote_access_port_mapping`; 1.22 added `remote_access_relay` and `remote_access_relay_enrolled`, an organization's own relay; 1.23 added `deliberation` to answers, the drafts Deliberate compared and its outcome; 1.24 added its `critiques` and `judge`; 1.25 added `POST /conversations/delete`, deleting several chats at once, and its answer, `ConversationsDeleted`).
- **Where it appears:** every event has `contract`, and so do answer metadata and run traces. Metadata saved before the contract existed has no `contract` and reads as 1.0. Every response carries the `Toskar-Contract` header, and the same value as `Yggdrasil-Contract`, its name from before the rename, and `GET /api/v1/version` has `contract` (`version`, `major`).
- **Minor versions** add fields or event types. Clients ignore what they do not know, so an older client keeps working.
- **Major versions** remove something or change its meaning. A client may send `Toskar-Client-Contract: 1.0`, or `Yggdrasil-Client-Contract: 1.0`, which every version accepts; when both are sent, `Toskar-Client-Contract` wins. A client built for another major version gets 426 with code `CONTRACT_MISMATCH`, and the message says whether to update the app or Toskar. A client that sends no header is served as before.
- **Compatibility test:** `tests/contract` records the contract's fields. It fails when one is removed or renamed within a major version, and when one is added without a minor version bump (`UPDATE_CONTRACT=1 go test ./tests/contract` records the new fields).

## Errors

An error is `{"error": {"code", "message", "details"}}`. `code` is stable, such as `MODEL_NOT_INSTALLED` or `MEMORY_LOOKS_SECRET`, and `details` has the values its message needs, such as `model_id`. Clients show text for the code from the catalog, `i18n/locales/<language>/errors.json`, in the App language; `message` is the English text, for logs, Diagnostics, and codes a client does not know yet. A code keeps its meaning, and a more specific code may replace a general one such as `BAD_REQUEST` or `INSTALL_FAILED`. Every code Toskar sends has English text in `errors.json`, and a test checks it.

A chat that fails while streaming sends `event: error_code` with the same `code`, `message`, and `details`, then `event: error` with the text, as before. Chat errors are recognized in core, once: `NO_MODEL_INSTALLED`, `NO_MODEL_ASSIGNED`, `MODEL_NOT_INSTALLED`, `RUNTIME_NOT_INSTALLED`, `CONTEXT_TOO_LONG`, `OUT_OF_MEMORY`, `COMPUTER_OFFLINE`, `CONNECTION_LOST`, `RUNTIME_ERROR`, and `MODEL_UNHEALTHY`, whose `error` text is the model's failure as JSON.

## Events

`GET /api/v1/events` is a server-sent event stream. Each event has `type`, `payload`, a timestamp, and `contract`. Clients should ignore types they do not know. Each person hears only their own chats, tasks, tool calls, memories, automations, and notifications (`chat.*`, `task.*`, `tool.*`, `agent.*`, `plan.*`, `orchestration.*`, `memory.*`, `automation.*`, `notification.*`, `artifact.*`); events about the computers and models go to everyone (#206).

| Type | Sent when |
| --- | --- |
| `chat.token` | A piece of an answer is written |
| `chat.complete`, `chat.error`, `chat.stopped` | A turn finishes, fails, or is stopped. `chat.complete` carries the answer's `meta` and `context`. |
| `chat.model_routed` | A model is chosen for a turn, with `reason`, and `fallback: true` after a failure |
| `chat.effort`, `chat.lookup`, `chat.verifying`, `chat.making_file`, `chat.making_media`, `chat.summarized` | Effort is set, the web is looked up first, figures are being checked, a requested file is being made, a requested picture or clip is being made (`kind` is `image`, `edit`, or `video`), or older messages were summarized |
| `plan.created`, `plan.step` | A request with several parts is planned, and each part runs |
| `verify.action`, `verify.done`, `verify.code`, `verify.consistency` | The answer checks: figures, claimed actions, code, and contradictions |
| `tool.requested`, `tool.started`, `tool.completed`, `tool.failed`, `tool.parsed` | A tool call waits for approval, runs, finishes, fails (with `kind`), or is read from text |

| `memory.saved`, `memory.deleted` | A memory is saved or forgotten from a chat |
| `orchestration.role` | A planner, worker, or reviewer starts, with the computer it runs on |
| `plan.planner`, `answer.reviewed` | The planner split a request (`parts`); the reviewer checked an answer (`changed`) |
| `deliberate.draft`, `deliberate.critique`, `deliberate.done` | Deliberate (#459): a draft starts (`status: running`) and finishes (`done` or `failed`, with `final`, `text`, and `chosen`), with `index`, `role`, and `node_id`; a draft is checked (`draft`, `critic`, `claims`, `disagreements`, `likely_errors`, `failed`); the drafts are settled (`drafts`, `agreeing`, `outcome`, `final`, and either `chosen` or `judged` with `judge_role` and `judge_node`) |
| `task.created`, `task.started`, `task.completed`, `task.failed` | An orchestration task changes state |
| `scheduler.placement` | Norn places work on a computer |
| `work.waiting` | Work waits for higher-priority work, with `class`, `label`, and `reason` |

## OpenAI-compatible API

Implemented routes:

| Method | Path |
| --- | --- |
| GET | `/v1/models` |
| POST | `/v1/chat/completions` |

No other `/v1` routes are registered. Embeddings, image generation, and the legacy completions API are not implemented.

### `GET /v1/models`

Returns `auto` and profiles, not raw files on disk:

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {"id": "auto", "object": "model", "owned_by": "yggdrasil"},
    {"id": "profile:general-assistant", "object": "model", "owned_by": "yggdrasil"}
  ]
}
```

Built-in profile ids include `general-assistant`, `programming`, and `research`. `owned_by` stays `yggdrasil` for contract 1.x, since clients may match on it.

### `POST /v1/chat/completions`

```json
{
  "model": "profile:general-assistant",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
  "stream": false
}
```

`model` may be `profile:<id>`, `auto`, or a bare id. A bare id is used as a profile id when that profile exists, and otherwise as a model override. `auto` picks an installed model for each request, as in chat.

The API gets the same assistant as chat: planning, web look-ups, connected services, answer checks, personalization, and specialized AIs.
- **Messages:** the whole `messages` array is used. The last `user` message is the turn, and earlier `user` and `assistant` messages are its history. `system` (and `developer`) messages are the calling app's instructions. They cannot change what tools may do.
- **Effort:** `reasoning_effort` maps to effort. `minimal` and `low` give Fast, `medium` gives Balanced, and `high` gives Thorough.
- **Sampling:** `temperature` (0 to 2; 0 gives the same most likely answer every time) and `max_tokens` (or `max_completion_tokens`) apply to the model calls that write the answer, on this computer, a paired one, or an external server. Planning, look-ups, and answer checks keep their own settings, so a small `max_tokens` doesn't cut them short. Left out, the model's defaults stand. Out of range is `400 INVALID_REQUEST`.

The optional `toskar` object holds the assistant's own controls. Its name from before the rename, `yggdrasil`, works too; when a request sends both, `toskar` wins.

```json
{
  "model": "auto",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What did we decide about the release?"}],
  "toskar": {
    "memory": true,
    "knowledge": true,
    "knowledge_sources": ["<mimir source id>"],
    "tools": ["internet.search", "internet.open"],
    "effort": "thorough",
    "placement": "local",
    "progress": true
  }
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `memory` | Use the person's memories. API requests use them only when they ask, unless the key says otherwise. "Remember that …" saves a memory only when memory is on for the request. |
| `knowledge` | Use the profile's connected knowledge. `knowledge_sources` adds sources. |
| `tools` | Narrow the profile's tools to these ids. A request can never add a tool or loosen a policy. |
| `effort` | `auto`, `fast`, `balanced`, or `thorough`; it takes precedence over `reasoning_effort`. |
| `placement` | `local` or `automatic`. |
| `progress` | With `"stream": true`, progress and tool activity arrive as chunks with an empty `delta` and a `toskar.event`, such as `{"type": "tool.started", "tool_id": "internet.search"}`. Before `[DONE]`, a last such chunk carries `toskar.sources`, `steps`, `notice`, and `files`. Each chunk has the same object as `yggdrasil` too, for clients written before the rename. Clients that ignore unknown fields see a plain OpenAI stream. |

`response_format` asks for JSON:
- **Types:** `{"type": "json_object"}`, or `{"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"schema": {...}}}` with a JSON Schema. Toskar checks `type`, `properties`, `required`, `enum`, and `items`.
- **Constrained output:** the model is told the shape. On this computer, llama.cpp also constrains the reply to the schema with a grammar. Such a turn is one reply: the web look-up still runs first, but there is no plan, tool call, file, or figure check.
- **Repairs:** the answer's JSON is found (fenced or not) and safely repaired: trailing commas, curly quotes, `"$1,299"` for a number, `"yes"` for a boolean.
- **Retry:** an answer that still does not fit is asked for once more, with the problems named.
- **Result:** the response content is compact JSON. When nothing fits, the request fails with 422 and lists the problems. A streamed request gets the JSON as one chunk.

A non-streaming response has a `toskar` object, and the same object as `yggdrasil`, with the answer's `sources`, `steps`, `notice`, and `files` when there are any.

Each API key has `permissions` that a request can only narrow:
- `memory` and `knowledge` are `never`, `on_request`, or `always`. The defaults are `on_request` for memory and `always` for knowledge.
- `tools` is `profile` (the default), `read_only`, or `none`.
- `placement` (true by default) lets a request choose where it runs.
- `profile` pins the key to one profile (#345; empty by default). Every request with the key answers with that profile and its topic controls: on `/v1/chat/completions` (`model` may be only `profile:<id>`, the bare id, `auto`, or left out), over MCP, and on `POST /api/v1/chat` and `POST /api/v1/tasks` (`profile_id` may be only that profile, and `model_id` only `auto` or empty). Naming another profile or a model returns `403 PROFILE_PINNED`, and `GET /v1/models` lists only that profile. A key can be pinned only to a profile that exists; if the profile is deleted later, the key's requests fail rather than fall back to another.

Asking for something a key does not allow returns 403 and says what was refused. Change a key's permissions with `PUT /api/v1/api-keys/{id}/permissions` or on the API Access page; rotating a key keeps them. When the API listens beyond this computer, every request from another machine needs a key, so its limits always apply there. On this computer a key is optional; its limits apply when the app sends it, and a request without one gets the defaults.

### Streaming

`"stream": true` responds with `Content-Type: text/event-stream`. Each event is `data: {json}` and the stream ends with `data: [DONE]`.

### Known differences

- `tool` messages and assistant `tool_calls` in the history are skipped.
- Tool definitions in the OpenAI request are not passed through. Tool use is controlled by the Toskar profile.
- The non-streaming `id` is the fixed string `chatcmpl-ygg`.
- A model must already be installed and startable. The HTTP call does not download one for you.

Examples that match this behavior are in [examples/](../examples/).

## GPU acceleration

When llama-server loads a model, it logs which devices it found, how many of the model's layers it put on a GPU, and the memory it took there. The daemon reads that log, so `GET /models/running` reports each model's `acceleration`:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `state` | `gpu` (every layer on a GPU), `partial` (some layers), `cpu` (on the CPU although this computer has a GPU), or `cpu_expected` (on the CPU, with no GPU to use) |
| `reason` | Why a state is short of `gpu`: `cpu_build` (the CPU-only llama.cpp is installed where the GPU build would run; reinstall it from Diagnostics), `gpu_memory` (the model doesn't fit in GPU memory), `gpu_unavailable` (the GPU build found no GPU it could use, such as without a graphics driver or Vulkan), or `no_gpu` |
| `backend` | `metal`, `vulkan`, `cuda`, `rocm`, `sycl`, or `cpu` |
| `devices` | The GPUs the model is on |
| `layers_offloaded`, `layers_total` | Layers on a GPU, of the model's total (0 when the runtime didn't say) |
| `gpu_memory_bytes` | What the model, its cache, and its working memory take on the GPUs |

The same report tags what each model produced, so a GPU reply can be told from a CPU one: `GET /performance` records and the models in a run (`GET /runs/{id}`) carry `backend` and `device` (such as `vulkan` and `AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX`, or `cpu` and an empty device), and so does every benchmark sample. They are empty for replies recorded before this, and for steps that ran on a paired computer. A saved answer's message metadata carries them too (`meta.backend`, `meta.device`, contract 1.8), so a client such as the iPhone app can say whether an answer came from the GPU. `GET /runtimes` lists what the installed llama.cpp build can run on in `detection.backends`, such as `["cpu", "vulkan"]`; a CPU-only build is `["cpu"]`.

`GET /health` sums it up in `acceleration`: the least accelerated loaded chat model's state, or `idle` when no model is loaded. It never changes `status`; a computer without a GPU is healthy.

### Live figures

`GET /performance/live` returns one entry per computer, this one first: `current`, `recent` (a reading every 5 seconds while a model is loaded, every minute otherwise, over the last hour), and `day` (per-minute averages). Each reading has `cpu_percent`, `memory_used_bytes`, `memory_total_bytes`, and `gpus`, each with `busy_percent`, `memory_used_bytes`, `memory_total_bytes`, `temperature_c`, and `power_watts`. A figure a computer can't give is left out, never reported as 0. None of them need root or admin rights:

| Platform | CPU and memory | GPU |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | `/proc/stat`, `/proc/meminfo` | AMD: the kernel's `gpu_busy_percent`, `mem_info_vram_*`, and hwmon temperature and power. Intel: hwmon where exposed. NVIDIA: `nvidia-smi` |
| macOS | `top`, `vm_stat` | `ioreg` (busy %, and on Apple silicon the shared memory the GPU is using). Temperature and power need root, so they are left out |
| Windows | `typeperf`, `GlobalMemoryStatusEx` | Windows' GPU counters (busy %, dedicated memory). NVIDIA: `nvidia-smi`, which also gives temperature and power |
